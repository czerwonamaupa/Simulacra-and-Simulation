# HISTORY: A RETRO SCENARIO #

In a violent and contemporary period of history (let's say between the two world wars and
the cold war), it is myth that invades cinema as imaginary content. It is the golden age of
despotic and legendary resurrections. Myth, chased from the real by the violence of
history, finds refuge in cinema.
Today, it is history itself that invades the cinema according to the same scenario - the
historical stake chased from our lives by this sort of immense neutralization, which is
dubbed peaceful coexistence on a global level, and pacified monotony on the quotidian
level - this history exorcised by a slowly or brutally congealing society celebrates its
resurrection in force on the screen, according to the same process that used to make lost
myths live again.
History is our lost referential, that is to say our myth. It is by virtue of this fact that it
takes the place of myths on the screen. The illusion would be to congratulate oneself on
this "awareness of history on the part of cinema," as one congratulated oneself on the
"entrance of politics into the university." Same misunderstanding, same mystification.
The politics that enter the university are those that come from history, a retro politics,
emptied of substance and legalized in their superficial exercise, with the air of a game
and a field of adventure, this kind of politics is like sexuality or permanent education (or
like social security in its time), that is, posthumous liberalization.
The great event of this period, the great trauma, is this decline of strong referentials, these
death pangs of the real and of the rational that open onto an age of simulation. Whereas
so many generations, and particularly the last, lived in the march of history, in the
euphoric or catastrophic expectation of a revolution - today one has the impression that
history has retreated, leaving behind it an indifferent nebula, traversed by currents, but
emptied of references. It is into this void that the phantasms of a past history recede, the
panoply of events, ideologies, retro fashions - no longer so much because people believe
in them or still place some hope in them, but simply to resurrect the period when at least
there was history, at least there was violence (albeit fascist), when at least life and death
were at stake. Anything serves to escape this void, this leukemia of history and of
politics, this hemorrhage of values - it is in proportion to this distress that all content can
be evoked pell-mell, that all previous history is resurrected in bulk - a controlling idea no
longer selects, only nostalgia endlessly accumulates: war, fascism, the pageantry of the
belle epoque, or the revolutionary struggles, everything is equivalent and is mixed
indiscriminately in the same morose and funereal exaltation, in the same retro
fascination. There is however a privileging of the immediately preceding era (fascism,
war, the period immediately following the war - the innumerable films that play on these
themes for us have a closer, more perverse, denser, more confused essence). One can
explain it by evoking the Freudian theory of fetishism (perhaps also a retro hypothesis).
This trauma (loss of referentials) is similar to the discovery of the difference between the
sexes in children, as serious, as profound, as irreversible: the fetishization of an object
intervenes to obscure this unbearable discovery, but precisely, says Freud, this object is
not just any object, it is often the last object perceived before the traumatic discovery.
Thus the fetishized history will preferably be the one immediately preceding our

"irreferential" era. Whence the omnipresence of fascism and of war in retro - a
coincidence, an affinity that is not at all political; it is naive to conclude that the
evocation of fascism signals a current renewal of fascism (it is precisely because one is
no longer there, because one is in something else, which is still less amusing, it is for this
reason that fascism can again become fascinating in its filtered cruelty, aestheticized by
retro).*1
History thus made its triumphal entry into cinema, posthumously (the term historical has
undergone the same fate: a "historical" moment, monument, congress, figure are in this
way designated as fossils). Its reinjection has no value as conscious awareness but only
as nostalgia for a lost referential.
This does not signify that history has never appeared in cinema as a powerful moment, as
a contemporary process, as insurrection and not as resurrection. In the "real" as in
cinema, there was history but there isn't any anymore. Today, the history that is "given
back" to us (precisely because it was taken from us) has no more of a relation to a
"historical real" than neofiguration in painting does to the classical figuration of the real.
Neofiguration is an invocation of resemblance, but at the same time the flagrant proof of
the disappearance of objects in their very representation: hyperreal. Therein objects shine
in a sort of hyperresemblance (like history in contemporary cinema) that makes it so that
fundamentally they no longer resemble anything, except the empty figure of resemblance,
the empty form of representation. It is a question of life or death: these objects are no
longer either living or deadly. That is why they are so exact, so minute, frozen in the state
in which a brutal loss of the real would have seized them. All, but not only, those
historical films whose very perfection is disquieting: Chinatown, Three Days of the
Condor, Barry Lyndon, 1900, All the President's Men, etc. One has the impression of it
being a question of perfect remakes, of extraordinary montages that emerge more from a
combinatory culture (or McLuhanesque mosaic), of large photo-, kino-,
historicosynthesis machines, etc., rather than one of veritable films. Let's understand each
other: their quality is not in question. The problem is rather that in some sense we are left
completely indifferent. Take The Last Picture Show: like me, you would have had to be
sufficiently distracted to have thought it to be an original production from the 1950s: a
very good film about the customs in and the atmosphere of the American small town. Just
a slight suspicion: it was a little too good, more in tune, better than the others, without the
psychological, moral, and sentimental blotches of the films of that era. Stupefaction when
one discovers that it is a 1970s film, perfect retro, purged, pure, the hyperrealist
restitution of 1950s cinema. One talks of remaking silent films, those will also
doubtlessly be better than those of the period. A whole generation of films is emerging
that will be to those one knew what the android is to man: marvelous artifacts, without
weakness, pleasing simulacra that lack only the imaginary, and the hallucination inherent
to cinema. Most of what we see today (the best) is already of this order. Barry Lyndon is
the best example: one never did better, one will never do better in ... in what? Not in
evoking, not even in evoking, in simulating. All the toxic radiation has been filtered, all
the ingredients are there, in precise doses, not a single error.
Cool, cold pleasure, not even aesthetic in the strict sense: functional pleasure, equational
pleasure, pleasure of machination. One only has to dream of Visconti (Guepard, Senso,
etc., which in certain respects make one think of Barry Lyndon) to grasp the difference,

not only in style, but in the cinematographic act. In Visconti, there is meaning, history, a
sensual rhetoric, dead time, a passionate game, not only in the historical content, but in
the mise-en-sc√®ne. None of that in Kubrick, who manipulates his film like a chess player,
who makes an operational scenario of history. And this does not return to the old
opposition between the spirit of finesse and the spirit of geometry: that opposition still
comes from the game and the stakes of meaning, whereas we are entering an era of films
that in themselves no longer have meaning strictly speaking, an era of great synthesizing
machines of varying geometry.
Is there something of this already in Leone's Westerns? Maybe. All the registers slide in
that direction. Chinatown: it is the detective movie renamed by laser. It is not really a
question of perfection: technical perfection can be part of meaning, and in that case it is
neither retro nor hyperrealist, it is an effect of art. Here, technical perfection is an effect
of the model: it is one of the referential tactical values. In the absence of real syntax of
meaning, one has nothing but the tactical values of a group in which are admirably
combined, for example, the CIA as a mythological machine that does everything, Robert
Redford as polyvalent star, social relations as a necessary reference to history, technical
virtuosity as a necessary reference to cinema.
The cinema and its trajectory: from the most fantastic or mythical to the realistic and the
hyperrealistic.
The cinema in its current efforts is getting closer and closer, and with greater and greater
perfection, to the absolute real, in its banality, its veracity, in its naked obviousness, in its
boredom, and at the same time in its presumption, in its pretension to being the real, the
immediate, the unsignified, which is the craziest of undertakings (similarly,
functionalism's pretension to designating - design - the greatest degree of correspondence
between the object and its function, and its use value, is a truly absurd enterprise); no
culture has ever had toward its signs this naive and paranoid, puritan and terrorist vision.
Terrorism is always that of the real.
Concurrently with this effort toward an absolute correspondence with the real, cinema
also approaches an absolute correspondence with itself - and this is not contradictory: it
is the very definition of the hyperreal. Hypotyposis and specularity. Cinema plagiarizes
itself, recopies itself, remakes its classics, retroactivates its original myths, remakes the
silent film more perfectly than the original, etc.: all of this is logical, the cinema is
fascinated by itself as a lost object as much as it (and we) are fascinated by the real as a
lost referent. The cinema and the imaginary (the novelistic, the mythical, unreality,
including the delirious use of its own technique) used to have a lively, dialectical, full,
dramatic relation. The relation that is being formed today between the cinema and the
real is an inverse, negative relation: it results from the loss of specificity of one and of the
other. The cold collage, the cool promiscuity, the asexual nuptials of two cold media that
evolve in an asymptotic line toward each other: the cinema attempting to abolish itself in
the cinematographic (or televised) hyperreal.
History is a strong myth, perhaps, along with the unconscious, the last great myth. It is a
myth that at once subtended the possibility of an "objective" enchainment of events and

causes and the possibility of a narrative enchainment of discourse. The age of history, if
one can call it that, is also the age of the novel. It is this fabulous character, the mythical
energy of an event or of a narrative, that today seems to be increasingly lost. Behind a
performative and demonstrative logic: the obsession with historical fidelity, with a
perfect rendering (as elsewhere the obsession with real time or with the minute
quotidianeity of Jeanne Hilmann doing the dishes), this negative and implacable fidelity
to the materiality of the past, to a particular scene of the past or of the present, to the
restitution of an absolute simulacrum of the past or the present, which was substituted for
all other value - we are all complicitous in this, and this is irreversible. Because cinema
itself contributed to the disappearance of history, and to the advent of the archive.
Photography and cinema contributed in large part to the secularization of history, to
fixing it in its visible, "objective" form at the expense of the myths that once traversed it.
Today cinema can place all its talent, all its technology in the service of reanimating what
it itself contributed to liquidating. It only resurrects ghosts, and it itself is lost therein.
* NOTE *
1. Fascism itself, the mystery of its appearance and of its collective energy, with which
no interpretation has been able to come to grips (neither the Marxist one of political
manipulation by dominant classes, nor the Reichian one of the sexual repression of the
masses, nor the Deleuzian one of despotic paranoia), can already be interpreted as the
"irrational" excess of mythic and political referentials, the mad intensification of
collective value (blood, race, people, etc.), the reinjection of death, of a "political
aesthetic of death" at a time when the process of the disenchantment of value and of
collective values, of the rational secularization and unidimensionalization of all life, of
the operationalization of all social and individual life already makes itself strongly felt in
the West. Yet again, everything seems to escape this catastrophe of value, this
neutralization and pacification of life. Fascism is a resistance to this, even if it is a
profound, irrational, demented resistance, it would not have tapped into this massive
energy if it hadn't been a resistance to something much worse. Fascism's cruelty, its terror
is on the level of this other terror that is the confusion of the real and the rational, which
deepened in the West, and it is a response to that.
