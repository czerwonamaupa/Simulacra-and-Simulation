# THE CHINA SYNDROME #

The fundamental stake is at the level of television and information. Just as the
extermination of the Jews disappeared behind the televised event Holocaust - the cold
medium of television having been simply substituted for the cold system of extermination
one believed to be exorcising through it - so The China Syndrome is a great example of
the supremacy of the televised event over the nuclear event which, itself, remains
improbable and in some sense imaginary.
Besides, the film shows this to be the case (without wanting to): that TV is present
precisely where it happens is not coincidental, it is the intrusion of TV into the reactor
that seems to give rise to the nuclear incident - because TV is like its anticipation and its
model in the everyday universe: telefission of the real and of the real world; because TV
and information in general are a form of catastrophe in the formal and topological sense
Rene Thorn gives the word: a radical qualitative change of a whole system. Or, rather,
TV and the nuclear are of the same nature: behind the "hot" and negentropic concepts of
energy and information, they have the same power of deterrence as cold systems do. TV
itself is also a nuclear process of chain reaction, but implosive: it cools and neutralizes
the meaning and the energy of events. Thus the nuclear, behind the presumed risk of
explosion, that is to say of hot catastrophe, conceals a long, cold catastrophe, the
universalization of a system of deterrence.
At the end of the film again comes the second massive intrusion of the press and of TV
that instigates the drama - the murder of the technical director by the Special Forces, a
drama that substitutes for the nuclear catastrophe that will not occur.
The homology of the nuclear and of television can be read directly in the images: nothing
resembles the control and telecommand headquarters of the nuclear power station more
than TV studios, and the nuclear consoles are combined with those of the recording and
broadcasting studios in the same imaginary. Thus everything takes place between these
two poles: of the other "center," that of the reactor, in principle the veritable heart of the
matter, we will know nothing; it, like the real, has vanished and become illegible, and is
at bottom unimportant in the film (when one attempts to suggest it to us, in its imminent
catastrophe, it does not work on the imaginary plane: the drama unfolds on the screens
and nowhere else).
Harrisburg,*1 Watergate, and Network: such is the trilogy of The China Syndrome - an
indissoluble trilogy in which one no longer knows which is the effect and which is the
symptom: the ideological argument (Watergate effect), isn't it nothing but the symptom
of the nuclear (Harrisburg effect) or of the computer science model (Network effect) - the
real (Harrisburg), isn't it nothing but the symptom of the imaginary (Network and China
Syndrome) or the opposite? Marvelous indifferentiation, ideal constellation of
simulation. Marvelous title, then, this China Syndrome, because the reversibility of
symptoms and their convergence in the same process constitute precisely what we call a
syndrome - that it is Chinese adds the poetic and intellectual quality of a conundrum or
supplication.

Obsessive conjunction of The China Syndrome and Harrisburg. But is all that so
involuntary? Without positing magical links between the simulacrum and the real, it is
clear that the Syndrome is not a stranger to the "real" accident in Harrisburg, not
according to a causal logic, but according to the relations of contagion and silent analogy
that link the real to models and to simulacra: to television's induction of the nuclear into
the film corresponds, with a troubling obviousness, the film's induction of the nuclear
incident in Harrisburg. Strange precession of a film over the real, the most surprising that
was given us to witness: the real corresponded point by point to the simulacrum,
including the suspended, incomplete character of the catastrophe, which is essential from
the point of view of deterrence: the real arranged itself, in the image of the film, to
produce a simulation of catastrophe.
From there to reverse our logic and to see in The China Syndrome the veritable event and
in Harrisburg its simulacrum, there is only one step that must be cheerfully taken.
Because it is via the same logic that, in the film, nuclear reality arises from the television
effect, and that in "reality" Harrisburg arises from the China Syndrome cinema effect.
But The China Syndrome is also not the original prototype of Harrisburg, one is not the
simulacrum of which the other would be the real: there are only simulacra, and
Harrisburg is a sort of second-order simulation. There is certainly a chain reaction
somewhere, and we will perhaps die of it, but this chain reaction is never that of the
nuclear, it is that of simulacra and of the simulation where all the energy of the real is
effectively swallowed, no longer in a spectacular nuclear explosion, but in a secret and
continuous implosion, and that today perhaps takes a more deathly turn than that of all
the explosions that rock us.
Because an explosion is always a promise, it is our hope: note how much, in the film as
in Harrisburg, the whole world waits for something to blow up, for destruction to
announce itself and remove us from this unnameable panic, from this panic of deterrence
that it exercises in the invisible form of the nuclear. That the "heart" of the reactor at last
reveals its hot power of destruction, that it reassures us about the presence of energy,
albeit catastrophic, and bestows its spectacle on us. Because unhappiness is when there is
no nuclear spectacle, no spectacle of nuclear energy in itself (Hiroshima is over), and it is
for that reason that it is rejected - it would be perfectly accepted if it lent itself to
spectacle as previous forms of energy did. Parousia of catastrophe: substantial food for
our messianic libido.
But that is precisely what will never happen. What will happen will never again be the
explosion, but the implosion. No more energy in its spectacular and pathetic form - all
the romanticism of the explosion, which had so much charm, being at the same time that
of revolution - but the cold energy of the simulacrum and of its distillation in
homeopathic doses in the cold systems of information.
What else do the media dream of besides creating the event simply by their presence?
Everyone decries it, but everyone is secretly fascinated by this eventuality. Such is the
logic of simulacra, it is no longer that of divine predestination, it is that of the precession
of models, but it is just as inexorable. And it is because of this that events no longer have
meaning: it is not that they are insignificant in themselves, it is that they were preceded

by the model, with which their processes only coincided. Thus it would have been
marvelous to repeat the script for The China Syndrome at Fessenheim, during the visit
offered to the journalists by the EDF (French Electric Company), to repeat on this
occasion the accident linked to the magic eye, to the provocative presence of the media.
Alas, nothing happened. And on the other hand yes! so powerful is the logic of simulacra:
a week after, the unions discovered fissures in the reactors. Miracle of contagions,
miracle of analogic chain reactions.
Thus, the essence of the film is not in any respect the Watergate effect in the person of
Jane Fonda, not in any respect TV as a means of exposing nuclear vices, but on the
contrary TV as the twin orbit and twin chain reaction of the nuclear one. Besides, just at
the end - and there the film is unrelenting in Regard to its own argument - when Jane
Fonda makes the truth explode directly (maximum Watergate effect), her image is
juxtaposed with what will inexorably follow it and efface it on the screen: a commercial
of some kind. The Network effect goes far beyond the Watergate effect and spreads
mysteriously into the Harrisburg effect, that is to say not into the nuclear threat, but into
the simulation of nuclear catastrophe.
So, it is simulation that is effective, never the real. The simulation of nuclear catastrophe
is the strategic result of this generic and universal undertaking of deterrence: accustoming
the people to the ideology and the discipline of absolute security - to the metaphysics of
fission and fissure. To this end the fissure must be a fiction. A real catastrophe would
delay things, it would constitute a retrograde incident, of the explosive kind (without
changing the course of things: did Hiroshima perceptibly delay, deter, the universal
process of deterrence?).
In the film, also, real fusion would be a bad argument: the film would regress to the level
of a disaster movie - weak by definition, because it means returning things to their pure
event. The China Syndrome, itself, finds its strength in filtering catastrophe, in the
distillation of the nuclear specter through the omnipresent hertzian relays of information.
It teaches us (once again without meaning to) that nuclear catastrophe does not occur, is
not meant to happen, in the real either, any more than the atomic clash was at the
dawning of the cold war. The equilibrium of terror rests on the eternal deferral of the
atomic clash. The atom and the nuclear are made to be disseminated for deterrent ends,
the power of catastrophe must, instead of stupidly exploding, be disseminated in
homeopathic, molecular doses, in the continuous reservoirs of information. Therein lies
the true contamination: never biological and radioactive, but, rather, a mental
destructuration through a mental strategy of catastrophe.
If one looks carefully, the film introduces us to this mental strategy, and in going further,
it even delivers a lesson diametrically opposed to that of Watergate: if every strategy
today is that of mental terror and of deterrence tied to the suspension and the eternal
simulation of catastrophe, then the only means of mitigating this scenario would be to
make the catastrophe arrive, to produce or to reproduce a real catastrophe. To which
Nature is at times given: in its inspired moments, it is God who through his cataclysms
unknots the equilibrium of terror in which humans are imprisoned. Closer to us, this is
what terrorism is occupied with as well: making real, palpable violence surface in
opposition to the invisible violence of security. Besides, therein lies terrorism's

ambiguity.
