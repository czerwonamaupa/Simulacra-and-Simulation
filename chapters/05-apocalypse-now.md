# APOCALYPSE NOW #

Coppola makes his film like the Americans made war - in this sense, it is the best
possible testimonial - with the same immoderation, the same excess of means, the same
monstrous candor . . . and the same success. The war as entrenchment, as technological
and psychedelic fantasy, the war as a succession of special effects, the war become film
even before being filmed. The war abolishes itself in its technological test, and for
Americans it was primarily that: a test site, a gigantic territory in which to test their arms,
their methods, their power. Coppola does nothing but that: test cinema's power of
intervention, test the impact of a cinema that has become an immeasurable machinery of
special effects. In this sense, his film is really the extension of the war through other
means, the pinnacle of this failed war, and its apotheosis. The war became film, the film
becomes war, the two are joined by their common hemorrhage into technology.
The real war is waged by Coppola as it is by Westmoreland: without counting the
inspired irony of having forests and Phillipine villages napalmed to retrace the hell of
South Vietnam. One revisits everything through cinema and one begins again: the
Molochian joy of filming, the sacrificial joy of so many millions spent, of such a
holocaust of means, of so many misadventures, and the remarkable paranoia that from the
beginning conceived of this film as a historical, global event, in which, in the mind of the
creator, the war in Vietnam would have been nothing other than what it is, would not
fundamentally have existed - and it is necessary for us to believe in this: the war in
Vietnam "in itself" perhaps in fact never happened, it is a dream, a baroque dream of
napalm and of the tropics, a psychotropic dream that had the goal neither of a victory nor
of a policy at stake, but, rather, the sacrificial, excessive deployment of a power already
filming itself as it unfolded, perhaps waiting for nothing but consecration by a superfilm,
which completes the mass-spectacle effect of this war.
No real distance, no critical sense, no desire for "raising consciousness" in relation to the
war: and in a sense this is the brutal quality of this film - not being rotten with the moral
psychology of war. Coppola can certainly deck out his helicopter captain in a ridiculous
hat of the light cavalry, and make him crush the Vietnamese village to the sound of
Wagner's music - those are not critical, distant signs, they are immersed in the machinery,
they are part of the special effect, and he himself makes movies in the same way, with the
same retro megalomania, and the same non-signifying furor, with the same clownish
effect in overdrive. But there it is, he hits us with that, it is there, it is bewildering, and
one can say to oneself: how is such a horror possible (not that of the war, but that of the
film strictly speaking)? But there is no answer, there is no possible verdict, and one can
even rejoice in this monstrous trick (exactly as with Wagner) - but one can always
retrieve a tiny little idea that is not nasty, that is not a value judgment, but that tells you
the war in Vietnam and this film are cut from the same cloth, that nothing separates them,
that this film is part of the war - if the Americans (seemingly) lost the other one, they
certainly won this one. Apocalypse Now is a global victory. Cinematographic power
equal and superior to that of the industrial and military complexes, equal or superior to
that of the Pentagon and of governments.
And all of a sudden, the film is not without interest: it retrospectively illuminates (not

even retrospectively, because the film is a phase of this war without end) what was
already crazy about this war, irrational in political terms: the Americans and the
Vietnamese are already reconciled, right after the end of the hostilities the Americans
offered economic aid, exactly as if they had annihilated the jungle and the towns, exactly
as they are making their film today. One has understood nothing, neither about the war
nor about cinema (at least the latter) if one has not grasped this lack of distinction that is
no longer either an ideological or a moral one, one of good and evil, but one of the
reversibility of both destruction and production, of the immanence of a thing in its very
revolution, of the organic metabolism of all the technologies, of the carpet of bombs in
the strip of film . . .
