# THE IMPLOSION OF MEANING IN THE MEDIA #

We live in a world where there is more and more information, and less and less meaning.
Consider three hypotheses.
Either information produces meaning (a negentropic factor), but cannot make up for the
brutal loss of signification in every domain. Despite efforts to reinject message and
content, meaning is lost and devoured faster than it can be reinjected. In this case, one
must appeal to a base productivity to replace failing media. This is the whole ideology of
free speech, of media broken down into innumerable individual cells of transmission, that
is, into "antimedia" (pirate radio, etc.).
Or information has nothing to do with signification. It is something else, an operational
model of another order, outside meaning and of the circulation of meaning strictly
speaking. This is Shannon's hypothesis: a sphere of information that is purely functional,
a technical medium that does not imply any finality of meaning, and thus should also not
be implicated in a value judgment. A kind of code, like the genetic code: it is what it is, it
functions as it does, meaning is something else that in a sense comes after the fact, as it
does for Monod in Chance and Necessity. In this case, there would simply be no
significant relation between the inflation of information and the deflation of meaning.
Or, very much on the contrary, there is a rigorous and necessary correlation between the
two, to the extent that information is directly destructive of meaning and signification, or
that it neutralizes them. The loss of meaning is directly linked to the dissolving,
dissuasive action of information, the media, and the mass media.
The third hypothesis is the most interesting but flies in the face of every commonly held
opinion. Everywhere socialization is measured by the exposure to media messages.
Whoever is underexposed to the media is desocialized or virtually asocial. Everywhere
information is thought to produce an accelerated circulation of meaning, a plus value of
meaning homologous to the economic one that results from the accelerated rotation of
capital. Information is thought to create communication, and even if the waste is
enormous, a general consensus would have it that nevertheless, as a whole, there be an
excess of meaning, which is redistributed in all the interstices of the social - just as
consensus would have it that material production, despite its dysfunctions and
irrationalities, opens onto an excess of wealth and social purpose. We are all
complicitous in this myth. It is the alpha and omega of our modernity, without which the
credibility of our social organization would collapse. Well, the fact is that it is collapsing,
and for this very reason: because where we think that information produces meaning, the
opposite occurs.
Information devours its own content. It devours communication and the social. And for
two reasons.
1. Rather than creating communication, it exhausts itself in the act of staging
communication. Rather than producing meaning, it exhausts itself in the staging of

meaning. A gigantic process of simulation that is very familiar. The nondirective
interview, speech, listeners who call in, participation at every level, blackmail through
speech: "You are concerned, you are the event, etc." More and more information is
invaded by this kind of phantom content, this homeopathic grafting, this awakening
dream of communication. A circular arrangement through which one stages the desire of
the audience, the antitheater of communication, which, as one knows, is never anything
but the recycling in the negative of the traditional institution, the integrated circuit of the
negative. Immense energies are deployed to hold this simulacrum at bay, to avoid the
brutal desimulation that would confront us in the face of the obvious reality of a radical
loss of meaning.
It is useless to ask if it is the loss of communication that produces this escalation in the
simulacrum, or whether it is the simulacrum that is there first for dissuasive ends, to
short-circuit in advance any possibility of communication (precession of the model that
calls an end to the real). Useless to ask which is the first term, there is none, it is a
circular process - that of simulation, that of the hyperreal. The hyperreality of
communication and of meaning. More real than the real, that is how the real is abolished.
Thus not only communication but the social functions in a closed circuit, as a lure - to
which the force of myth is attached. Belief, faith in information attach themselves to this
tautological proof that the system gives of itself by doubling the signs of an unlocatable
reality.
But one can believe that this belief is as ambiguous as that which was attached to myths
in ancient societies. One both believes and doesn't. One does not ask oneself, "I know
very well, but still." A sort of inverse simulation in the masses, in each one of us,
corresponds to this simulation of meaning and of communication in which this system
encloses us. To this tautology of the system the masses respond with ambivalence, to
deterrence they respond with disaffection, or with an always enigmatic belief. Myth
exists, but one must guard against thinking that people believe in it: this is the trap of
critical thinking that can only be exercised if it presupposes the naivete and stupidity of
the masses.
2. Behind this exacerbated mise-en-scène of communication, the mass media, the
pressure of information pursues an irresistible destructuration of the social.
Thus information dissolves meaning and dissolves the social, in a sort of nebulous state
dedicated not to a surplus of innovation, but, on the contrary, to total entropy.*1
Thus the media are producers not of socialization, but of exactly the opposite, of the
implosion of the social in the masses. And this is only the macroscopic extension of the
implosion of meaning at the microscopic level of the sign. This implosion should be
analyzed according to McLuhan's formula, the medium is the message, the consequences
of which have yet to be exhausted.
That means that all contents of meaning are absorbed in the only dominant form of the
medium. Only the medium can make an event - whatever the contents, whether they are
conformist or subversive. A serious problem for all counterinformation, pirate radios,

antimedia, etc. But there is something even more serious, which McLuhan himself did
not see. Because beyond this neutralization of all content, one could still expect to
manipulate the medium in its form and to transform the real by using the impact of the
medium as form. If all the content is wiped out, there is perhaps still a subversive,
revolutionary use value of the medium as such. That is - and this is where McLuhan's
formula leads, pushed to its limit - there is not only an implosion of the message in the
medium, there is, in the same movement, the implosion of the medium itself in the real,
the implosion of the medium and of the real in a sort of hyperreal nebula, in which even
the definition and distinct action of the medium can no longer be determined.
Even the "traditional" status of the media themselves, characteristic of modernity, is put
in question. McLuhan's formula, the medium is the message, which is the key formula of
the era of simulation (the medium is the message - the sender is the receiver - the
circularity of all poles - the end of panoptic and perspectival space - such is the alpha and
omega of our modernity), this very formula must be imagined at its limit where, after all
the contents and messages have been volatilized in the medium, it is the medium itself
that is volatilized as such. Fundamentally, it is still the message that lends credibility to
the medium, that gives the medium its determined, distinct status as the intermediary of
communication. Without a message, the medium also falls into the indefinite state
characteristic of all our great systems of judgment and value. A single model, whose
efficacy is immediate, simultaneously generates the message, the medium, and the "real."
Finally, the medium is the message not only signifies the end of the message, but also the
end of the medium. There are no more media in the literal sense of the word (I'm
speaking particularly of electronic mass media) - that is, of a mediating power between
one reality and another, between one state of the real and another. Neither in content, nor
in form. Strictly, this is what implosion signifies. The absorption of one pole into another,
the short-circuiting between poles of every differential system of meaning, the erasure of
distinct terms and oppositions, including that of the medium and of the real - thus the
impossibility of any mediation, of any dialectical intervention between the two or from
one to the other. Circularity of all media effects. Hence the impossibility of meaning in
the literal sense of a unilateral vector that goes from one pole to another. One must
envisage this critical but original situation at its very limit: it is the only one left us. It is
useless to dream of revolution through content, useless to dream of a revelation through
form, because the medium and the real are now in a single nebula whose truth is
indecipherable.
The fact of this implosion of contents, of the absorption of meaning, of the evanescence
of the medium itself, of the reabsorption of every dialectic of communication in a total
circularity of the model, of the implosion of the social in the masses, may seem
catastrophic and desperate. But this is only the case in light of the idealism that
dominates our whole view of information. We all live by a passionate idealism of
meaning and of communication, by an idealism of communication through meaning, and,
from this perspective, it is truly the catastrophe of meaning that lies in wait for us.
But one must realize that "catastrophe" has this "catastrophic" meaning of end and
annihilation only in relation to a linear vision of accumulation, of productive finality,
imposed on us by the system. Etymologically, the term itself only signifies the curvature,

the winding down to the bottom of a cycle that leads to what one could call the "horizon
of the event," to an impassable horizon of meaning: beyond that nothing takes place that
has meaning for us - but it suffices to get out of this ultimatum of meaning in order for
the catastrophe itself to no longer seem like a final and nihilistic day of reckoning, such
as it functions in our contemporary imaginary.
Beyond meaning, there is the fascination that results from the neutralization and the
implosion of meaning. Beyond the horizon of the social, there are the masses, which
result from the neutralization and the implosion of the social.
What is essential today is to evaluate this double challenge the challenge of the masses to
meaning and their silence (which is not at all a passive resistance) - the challenge to
meaning that comes from the media and its fascination. All the marginal, alternative
efforts to revive meaning are secondary in relation to that challenge.
Evidently, there is a paradox in this inextricable conjunction of the masses and the media:
do the media neutralize meaning and produce unformed [informe] or informed [informée]
masses, or is it the masses who victoriously resist the media by directing or absorbing all
the messages that the media produce without responding to them? Sometime ago, in
"Requiem for the Media," I analyzed and condemned the media as the institution of an
irreversible model of communication without a response. But today? This absence of a
response can no longer be understood at all as a strategy of power, but as a
counterstrategy of the masses themselves when they encounter power. What then?
Are the mass media on the side of power in the manipulation of the masses, or are they
on the side of the masses in the liquidation of meaning, in the violence perpetrated on
meaning, and in fascination? Is it the media that induce fascination in the masses, or is it
the masses who direct the media into the spectacle? Mogadishu-Stammheim: the media
make themselves into the vehicle of the moral condemnation of terrorism and of the
exploitation of fear for political ends, but simultaneously, in the most complete
ambiguity, they propagate the brutal charm of the terrorist act, they are themselves
terrorists, insofar as they themselves march to the tune of seduction (cf. Umberto Eco on
this eternal moral dilemma: how can one not speak of terrorism, how can one find a good
use of the media - there is none). The media carry meaning and countermeaning, they
manipulate in all directions at once, nothing can control this process, they are the vehicle
for the simulation internal to the system and the simulation that destroys the system,
according to an absolutely Mobian and circular logic - and it is exactly like this. There is
no alternative to this, no logical resolution. Only a logical exacerbation and a catastrophic
resolution.
With one caution. We are face to face with this system in a double situation and insoluble
double bind - exactly like children faced with the demands of the adult world. Children
are simultaneously required to constitute themselves as autonomous subjects,
responsible, free and conscious, and to constitute themselves as submissive, inert,
obedient, conforming objects. The child resists on all levels, and to a contradictory
demand he responds with a double strategy. To the demand of being an object, he
opposes all the practices of disobedience, of revolt, of emancipation; in short, a total
claim to subjecthood. To the demand of being a subject he opposes, just as obstinately

and efficaciously, an object's resistance, that is to say, exactly the opposite: childishness,
hyperconformism, total dependence, passivity, idiocy. Neither strategy has more
objective value than the other. The subject-resistance is today unilaterally valorized and
viewed as positive - just as in the political sphere only the practices of freedom,
emancipation, expression, and the constitution of a political subject are seen as valuable
and subversive. But this is to ignore the equal, and without a doubt superior, impact of all
the object practices, of the renunciation of the subject position and of meaning - precisely
the practices of the masses - that we bury under the derisory terms of alienation and
passivity. The liberating practices respond to one of the aspects of the system, to the
constant ultimatum we are given to constitute ourselves as pure objects, but they do not
respond at all to the other demand, that of constituting ourselves as subjects, of liberating
ourselves, expressing ourselves at whatever cost, of voting, producing, deciding,
speaking, participating, playing the game - a form of blackmail and ultimatum just as
serious as the other, even more serious today. To a system whose argument is oppression
and repression, the strategic resistance is the liberating claim of subjecthood. But this
strategy is more reflective of the earlier phase of the system, and even if we are still
confronted with it, it is no longer the strategic terrain: the current argument of the system
is to maximize speech, the maximum production of meaning. Thus the strategic
resistance is that of the refusal of meaning and of the spoken word - or of the
hyperconformist simulation of the very mechanisms of the system, which is a form of
refusal and of non-reception. It is the strategy of the masses: it is equivalent to returning
to the system its own logic by doubling it, to reflecting meaning, like a mirror, without
absorbing it. This strategy (if one can still speak of strategy) prevails today, because it
was ushered in by that phase of the system which prevails.
To choose the wrong strategy is a serious matter. All the movements that only play on
liberation, emancipation, on the resurrection of a subject of history, of the group, of the
word based on "consciousness raising," indeed a "raising of the unconscious" of subjects
and of the masses, do not see that they are going in the direction of the system, whose
imperative today is precisely the overproduction and regeneration of meaning and of
speech.
* NOTE *
1. Here we have not spoken of information except in the social register of
communication. But it would be enthralling to consider this hypothesis even within the
parameters of cybernetic information theory. There also, the fundamental thesis calls for
this information to be synonymous with negentropy with the resistance to entropy, with
an excess of meaning and organization. But it would be useful to posit the opposite
hypothesis: INFORMATION = ENTROPY. For example: the information or knowledge
that can be obtained about a system or an event is already a form of the neutralization and
entropy of this system (to be extended to science in general, and to the social sciences
and humanities in particular). Information in which an event is reflected or broadcast is
already a degradedform of this event. Do not hesitate to analyze the media's intervention
in May 1968 in these terms. The extension of the student action permitted the general
strike, but the latter was precisely a black box that neutralized the original virulence of
the movement. Amplification was itself a mortal trap and not a positive extension. One
should be wary of the universalization of struggles through information. One should be

wary of solidarity campaigns at every level, of this simultaneously electronic and worldly
solidarity. Every strategy of the universalization of differences is an entropic strategy of
the system.
