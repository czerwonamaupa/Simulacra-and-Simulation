# CRASH #

From a classical (even cybernetic) perspective, technology is an extension of the body. It
is the functional sophistication of a human organism that permits it to be equal to nature
and to invest triumphally in nature. From Marx to McLuhan, the same functionalist
vision of machines and language: they are relays, extensions, media mediators of nature
ideally destined to become the organic body of man. In this "rational" perspective the
body itself is nothing but a medium.
On the other hand, in the apocalyptic and baroque version of Crash*1 technology is the
mortal deconstruction of the body - no longer a functional medium, but the extension of
death - the dismemberment and cutting to pieces, not in the pejorative illusion of a lost
unity of the subject (which is still the horizon of psychoanalysis), but in the explosive
vision of a body delivered to "symbolic wounds," of a body confused with technology in
its violating and violent dimension, in the savage and continual surgery that violence
exercises: incisions, excisions, scarifications, the chasms of the body, of which the sexual
wounds and pleasures of the body are only a particular case (and mechanical servitude in
work, its pacified caricature) - a body without organs or pleasure of the organs, entirely
subjected to the mark, to cutting, to the technical scar - under the shining sign of a
sexuality without a referential and without limits.
Her mutilation and death became a coronation of her image at the hands of a colliding
technology, a celebration of her individual limbs and facial planes, gestures and skin
tones. Each of the spectators at the accident site would carry away an image of the
violent transformation of this woman, of the complex of wounds that fused together her
own sexuality and the hard technology of the automobile. Each of them would join his
own imagination, the tender membranes of his mucous surfaces, his grooves of erectile
tissue, to the wounds of this minor actresss through the medium of his own motorcar,
touching them as he drove in a medley of stylized postures. Each would place his lips on
those bleeding apertures, lay his own nasal septum against the lesions of her left hand,
press his eyelids against the exposed tendon of her forefinger, the dorsal surface of his
erect penis against the ruptured lateral walls of her vagina. The automobile crash had
made possible the final and longed-for union of the actress and the members of her
audience. (Pp. 189-90)
Technology is never grasped except in the (automobile) accident, that is to say in the
violence done to technology itself and in the violence done to the body. It is the same:
any shock, any blow, any impact, all the metallurgy of the accident can be read in the
semiurgy of the body - neither an anatomy nor a physiology, but a semiurgy of
contusions, scars, mutilations, wounds that are so many new sexual organs opened on the
body. In this way, gathering the body as labor in the order of production is opposed to the
dispersion of the body as anagram in the order of mutilation. Goodbye "erogeneous
zones": everything becomes a hole to offer itself to the discharge reflex. But above all (as
in primitive initiation tortures, which are not ours), the whole body becomes a sign to
offer itself to the exchange of bodily signs. Body and technology diffracting their

bewildered signs through each other. Carnal abstraction and design.
No affect behind all that, no psychology, no flux or desire, no libido or death drive.
Naturally, death is implicated in an unlimited exploration of the possible violence done to
the body, but this is never, as in sadism or masochism, with an express and perverse aim
of violence, a distortion of meaning and of sex (in relation to what?). No repressed
unconscious (affects or representations), except in a second reading that would still
reinject a forced meaning, based on the psychoanalytic model. The non-meaning, the
savagery, of this mixture of the body and of technology is immanent, it is the immediate
reversion of one to the other, and from this results a sexuality without precedent - a sort
of potential vertigo linked to the pure inscription of the empty signs of this body.
Symbolic ritual of incision and marks, like the graffiti on New York subways.
Another point in common: it is no longer a question, in Crash, of accidental signs that
would only appear at the margins of the system. The Accident is no longer this interstitial
bricolage that it still is in the highway accident - the residual bricolage of the death drive
for the new leisure classes. The car is not the appendix of a domestic, immobile universe,
there is no longer a private and domestic universe, there are only incessant figures of
circulation, and the Accident is everywhere, the elementary, irreversible figure, the
banality of the anomaly of death. It is no longer at the margin, it is at the heart. It is no
longer the exception to a triumphal rationality, it has become the Rule, it has devoured
the Rule. It is no longer even the "accursed share," the one conceded to destiny by the
system itself, and included in its general reckoning. Everything is reversed. It is the
Accident that gives form to life, it is the Accident, the insane, that is the sex of life. And
the automobile, the magnetic sphere of the automobile, which ends by investing the entire
universe with its tunnels, highways, toboggans, exchangers, its mobile dwelling as
universal prototype, is nothing but the immense metaphor of life.
Dysfunction is no longer possible in a universe of the accident - therefore no perversion
is either. The Accident, like death, is no longer of the order of the neurotic, the repressed,
the residual or the transgressive, it is the instigator of a new mode of nonperverse
pleasure (contrary to the author himself, who speaks in the introduction of a new perverse
logic, one must resist the moral temptation of reading Crash as perversion), of a strategic
organization of life that starts from death. Death, wounds, mutilations are no longer
metaphors of castration, exactly the opposite - not even the opposite. Only the fetishistic
metaphor is perverse, seduction via the model, via the interposed fetish, or via the
medium of language. Here, death and sex are read on the same level as the body, without
phantasms, without metaphor, without sentences - different from the Machine of The
Penal Colony, where the body in its wounds is still only the support of a textual
inscription. Thus one, Kafka's machine, is still puritan, repressive, "a signifying
machine" Deleuze would say, whereas the technology in Crash is shining, seductive, or
dull and innocent. Seductive because denuded of meaning, and because it is the simple
mirror of torn-up bodies. And Vaughan's body is in its turn the mirror of bent chrome, of
crumpled fenders, of sheet iron stained with sperm. Bodies and technology combined,
seduced, inextricable.
As Vaughan turned the car into a filling station courtyard the scarlet light from the neon

sign over the portico flared across these grainy photographs of appalling injuries: the
breasts of teenage girls deformed by instrument binnacles, the partial mamoplasties . . .
nipples sectioned by manufacturers' dashboard medallions; injuries to male and female
genitalia caused by steering wheel shrouds, windshields during ejection . . . A succession
of photographs of mutilated penises, sectioned vulvas and crushed testicles passed
through the flaring light as Vaughan stood by the girl filling-station attendant at the rear
of the car, jocularly talking to her about her body. In several of the photographs the
source of the wound was indicated by a detail of that portion of the car which had caused
the injury: beside a casualty ward photograph of a bifurcated penis was an inset of a
handbrake unit; above a close-up of a massively bruised vulva was a steering-wheel boss
and its manufacturer's medallion. These unions of torn genitalia and sections of car body
and instrument panel formed a series of disturbing modules, units in a new currency of
pain and desire. (P. 134)
Each mark, each trace, each scar left on the body is like an artificial invagination, like the
scarifications of savages, which are always a vehement response to the absence of the
body. Only the wounded body exists symbolically - for itself and for others - "sexual
desire" is never anything but the possiblity bodies have of combining and exchanging
their signs. Now, the few natural orifices to which one usually attaches sex and sexual
activities are nothing next to all the possible wounds, all the artificial orifices (but why
"artificial"?), all the breaches through which the body is reversibilized and, like certain
topological spaces, no longer knows either interior nor exterior. Sex as we know it is
nothing but a minute and specialized definition of all the symbolic and sacrificial
practices to which a body can open itself, no longer though nature, but through artifice,
through the simulacrum, through the accident. Sex is nothing but this rarefaction of a
drive called desire on previously prepared zones. It is largely overtaken by the fan of
symbolic wounds, which is in some sense the ana-grammatization of sex on the whole
length of the body - but now precisely, it is no longer sex, it is something else, sex, itself,
is nothing but the inscription of a privileged signifier and some secondary marks nothing next to the exchange of all the signs and wounds of which the body is capable.
The savages knew how to use the whole body to this end, in tattooing, torture, initiation sexuality was only one of the possible metaphors of symbolic exchange, neither the most
significant, nor the most prestigious, as it has become for us in its obsessional and
realistic reference, thanks to its organic and functional character (including in orgasm).
As the car travelled for the first time at twenty miles an hour Vaughan drew his fingers
from the girl's vulva and anus, rotated his hips and inserted his penis in her vagina.
Headlamps flared above us as the stream of cars moved up the slope of the overpass. In
the rear-view mirror I could still see Vaughan and the girl, their bodies lit by the car
behind, reflected in the black trunk of the Lincoln and a hundred points of the interior
trim. In the chromium ashtray I saw the girl's left breast and erect nipple. In the vinyl
window gutter I saw deformed sections of Vaughan's thighs and her abdomen forming a
bizarre anatomical junction. Vaughan lifted the young woman astride him, his penis
entering her vagina again. In a triptych of images reflected in the speedometer, the clock
and revolution counter, the sexual act between Vaughan and this young woman took
place in the hooded grottoes of these luminescent dials, moderated by the surging needle
of the speedometer. The jutting carapace of the instrument panel and the stylized

sculpture of the steering column shroud reflected a dozen images of her rising and falling
buttocks. As I propelled the car at fifty miles an hour along the open deck of the overpass
Vaughan arched his back and lifted the young woman into the full glare of the headlamps
behind us. Her sharp breasts flashed within the chromium and glass cage of the speeding
car. Vaughan's strongpelvic spasms coincided with the thudding passage of the lamp
standards anchored in the overpass at hundred-yard intervals. As each one approached his
hips kicked into the girl, driving his penis into her vagina, his hands splaying her
buttocks to reveal her anus as the yellow light filled the car. (R 143)
Here, all the erotic terms are technical. No ass, no dick, no cunt but: the anus, the rectum,
the vulva, the penis, coitus. No slang, that is to say no intimacy of sexual violence, but a
functional language: the adequation of chrome and mucous as of one form to another.
The same goes for the correspondence of death and sex: it is more as if they are covered
together in a sort of technical superdesign than articulated according to pleasure. Besides,
it is not a question of orgasm, but of pure and simple discharge. And the coitus and sperm
that traverse the book have no more sensual value than the filigree of wounds has violent
meaning, even metaphorically speaking. They are nothing but signatures - in the final
scene, X imprints the car wrecks with his sperm.
Pleasure (whether perverse or not) was always mediated by a technical apparatus, by a
mechanism of real objects but more often of phantasms - it always implies an
intermediary manipulation of scenes or gadgets. Here, pleasure is only orgasm, that is to
say, confused on the same wave length with the violence of the technical apparatus, and
homogenized by the only technique, one summed up by a single object: the automobile.
We had entered an immense traffic jam. From the junction of the motorway and Western
Avenue to the ascent ramp of the flyover the traffic lanes were packed with vehicles,
windshields bleaching out the molten colours of the sun setting above the western
suburbs of London. Brake-lights flared in the evening air, glowing in the huge pool of
cellulosed bodies. Vaughan sat with one arm out of the passenger window. He slapped
the door impatiently, pounding the panel with his fist. To our right the high wall of a
double-decker airline coach formed a cliff of faces. The passengers at the windows
resembled rows of the dead looking down at us from the galleries of a columbarium. The
enormous energy of the twentieth century, enough to drive the planet into a new orbit
around a happier star, was being expended to maintain this immense motionless pause.
(P. 151)
Around me, down the entire length of Western Avenue, along both ramps of the flyover,
stretched an immense congestion of traffic held up by the accident. Standing at the centre
of this paralysed hurricane, I felt completely at ease, as if my obsessions with the
endlessly multiplying vehicles had at last been relieved. (P. 156)
Yet in Crash, another dimension is inseparable from the confused ones of technology and
of sex (united in a work of death that is never a work of mourning): it is that of the
photograph and of cinema. The shining and saturated surface of traffic and of the

accident is without depth, but it is always doubled in Vaughan's camera lens. The lens
stockpiles and hoards accident photos like dossiers. The general repetition of the crucial
event that it foments (his automobile death and the simultaneous death of the star in a
collision with Elizabeth Taylor, a crash meticulously simulated and refined over a period
of months) occurs outside a cinematographic take. This universe would be nothing
without this hyperreal disconnection. Only the doubling, the unfolding of the visual
medium in the second degree can produce the fusion of technology, sex, and death. But
in fact, the photograph here is not a medium nor is it of the order of representation. It is
not a question of a "supplementary" abstraction of the image, nor of a spectacular
compulsion, and Vaughan's position is never that of the voyeur or the pervert. The
photographic film (like transistorized music in automobiles and apartments) is part of the
universal, hyperreal, metallized, and corporeal layer of traffic and flows. The photo is no
more of a medium than technology or the body - all are simultaneous in a universe where
the anticipation of the event coincides with its reproduction, indeed with its "real"
production. No more temporal depth either - just like the past, the future ceases to exist in
turn. In fact, it is the eye of the camera that is substituted for time, just as it is for any
other depth, that of affect, space, language. It is not another dimension, it simply signfies
that this universe is without secrets.
The mannequin rider sat well back, the onrushing air lifting his chin. His hands were
shackled to the handlebars like a kamikaze pilot's. His long thorax was plastered with
metering devices. In front of him, their expressions equally vacant, the family of four
mannequins sat in their vehicle. Their faces were marked with cryptic symbols.
A harsh whipping noise came toward us, the sound of the metering coils skating along
the grass beside the rail. There was a violent metallic explosion as the motorcycle struck
the front of the saloon car. The two vehicles veered sideways towards the line of startled
spectators. I regained my balance, involuntarily holding Vaughan's shoulder, as the
motorcycle and its driver sailed over the bonnet of the car and struck the windshield, then
careened across the roof in a black mass of fragments. The car plunged ten feet back on
its hawsers. It came to rest astride the rails. The bonnet, windshield and roof had been
crushed by the impact. Inside the cabin, the lopsided family lurched across each other,
the decapitated torso of the front-seat woman passenger embedded in the fractured
windshield . . . Shavings of fibreglass from its face and shoulders speckled the glass
around the test car like silver snow, a death confetti. Helen Remington held my arm. She
smiled at me, nodding encouragingly as if urging a child across some mental hurdle. "We
can have a look at it again on the Ampex. They're showing it in slow-motion." (Pp. 12425)
In Crash, everything is hyperfunctional, since traffic and accident, technology and death,
sex and simulation are like a single, large synchronous machine. It is the same universe
as that of the hypermarket, where the commodity becomes "hypercom-modity," that is to
say itself always already captured, and the whole atmosphere with it, in the incessant
figures of traffic. But at the same time, the functionalism of Crash devours its own
rationality, because it does not know dysfunction. It is a radical functionalism that
reaches its paradoxical limits and burns them. At once it again becomes an indefinable,

therefore fascinating, object. Neither good nor bad: ambivalent. Like death or fashion, it
becomes all of a sudden an object at the crossroads, whereas good old functionalism,
even contested, no longer is at all - that is to say, it becomes a path leading more quickly
than the main road, or leading where the main road does not lead or, better yet, and to
parody Littre in a pataphysical mode, "a path leading nowhere, but leading there faster
than the others."
This is what distinguishes Crash from all science fiction or almost all, which most of the
time still revolves around the old couple function/dysfunction, which it projects in the
future along the same lines of force and the same finalities that are those of the normal
universe. There fiction surpasses reality (or the opposite), but according to the same rules
of the game. In Crash, no more fiction or reality, it is hyperreality that abolishes both.
Not even a critical regression is possible. This mutating and commutating world of
simulation and death, this violently sexed world, but one without desire, full of violated
and violent bodies, as if neutralized, this chromatic world and metallic intensity, but one
void of sensuality, hypertechnology without finality - is it good or bad? We will never
know. It is simply fascinating, though this fascination does not imply a value judgement.
There lies the miracle of Crash. Nowhere does this moral gaze surface - the critical
judgment that is still part of the functionality of the old world. Crash is hypercriticism
(there also in contrast to its author who, in the introduction, speaks of the "warning
against that brutal, erotic, and overlit realm that beckons more and more persuasively to
us from the margins of the technological landscape"*2). Few books, few films reach this
resolution of all finality or critical negativity, this dull splendor of banality or of violence.
Nashville, Clockwork Orange.
After Borges, but in another register, Crash is the first great novel of the universe of
simulation, the one with which we will all now be concerned - a symbolic universe, but
one which, through a sort of reversal of the mass-mediated substance (neon, concrete,
car, erotic machinery), appears as if traversed by an intense force of initiation.
The last of the amublances drove away, its siren wailing. The spectators returned to their
cars, or climbed the embankment to the break in the wire fence. An adolescent girl in a
denim suit walked past us, her young man with an arm around her waist. He held her
right breast with the back of his hand, stroking her nipple with his knuckles. They
stepped into a beach buggy slashed with pennants and yellow paint and drove off, horn
hooting eccentrically. A burly man in a truck-driver's jacket helped his wife up the
embankment, a hand on her buttocks. This pervasive sexuality filled the air, as if we were
members of a congregation leaving after a sermon urging us to celebrate our sexualities
with friends and strangers, and were driving into the night to imitate the bloody eucharist
we had observed with the most unlikely partners. (R 157)
