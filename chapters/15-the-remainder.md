# THE REMAINDER #

When everything is taken away, nothing is left.
This is false.
The equation of everything and nothing, the subtraction of the remainder, is totally false.
It is not that there is no remainder. But this remainder never has an autonomous reality,
nor its own place: it is what partition, circumscription, exclusion designate... what else? It
is through the subtraction of the remainder that reality is founded and gathers strength...
what else?
What is strange is precisely that there is no opposing term in a binary opposition: one can
say the right/the left, the same/the other, the majority/the minority, the crazy/the normal,
etc. - but the remainder/ ? Nothing on the other side of the slash.
"The sum and the remainder," the addition and the remainder, the operation and the
remainder are not distinctive oppositions.
And yet, what is on the other side of the remainder exists, it is even the marked term, the
powerful moment, the privileged element in this strangely asymmetrical opposition, in
this structure that is not one. But this marked term has no name. It is anonymous, it is
unstable and without definition. Positive, but only the negative gives it the force of
reality. In a strict sense, it cannot be defined except as the remainder of the remainder.
Thus the remainder refers to much more than a clear division in two localized terms, to a
turning and reversible structure, an always imminent structure of reversion, in which one
never knows which is the remainder of the other. In no other structure can one create this
reversion, or this mise-en-abyme: the masculine is not the feminine of the feminine, the
normal is not the crazy of the crazy, the right is not the left of the left, etc. Perhaps only
in the mirror can the question be posed: which, the real or the image, is the reflection of
the other? In this sense one can speak of the remainder as a mirror, or of the mirror of the
remainder. It is that in both cases the line of structural demarcation, the line of the
sharing of meaning, has become a wavering one, it is that meaning (most literally: the
possibility of going from one point to another according to a vector determined by the
respective position of the terms) no longer exists. There is no longer a respective position
- the real disappearing to make room for an image, more real than the real, and
conversely - the remainder disappearing from the assigned location to resurface inside
out, in what it was the remainder of, etc.
The same is true of the social. Who can say if the remainder of the social is the residue of
the nonsocialized, or if it is not the social itself that is the remainder, the gigantic waste
product... of what else? Of a process, which even if it were to completely disappear and
had no name except the social would nevertheless only be its remainder. The residue can
be completely at the level of the real. When a system has absorbed everything, when one
has added everything up, when nothing remains, the entire sum turns to the remainder

and becomes the remainder.
Witness the "Society" column of Le Monde, in which paradoxically, only immigrants,
delinquents, women, etc. appear - everything that has not been socialized, "social" cases
analogous to pathological cases. Pockets to be reabsorbed, segments that the "social"
isolates as it grows. Designated as "residual" at the horizon of the social, they enter its
jurisdiction in this way and are destined to find their place in an enlarged sociality. It is
for this remainder that the social machine is recharged and finds new energy. But what
happens when everything is sponged up, when everything is socialized? Then the
machine stops, the dynamic is reversed, and it is the whole social system that becomes
residue. As the social in its progression eliminates all the residue, it itself becomes
residual. In designating residual categories as "Society," the social designates itself as a
remainder.
The impossibility of determining what is the remainder of the other characterizes the
phase of simulation and the death throes of distinctive systems, a phase when everything
becomes a remainder and a residual. Inversely, the disappearance of the fatidic and
structural slash that isolated the rest of ??? and that now permits each term to be the
remainder of the other term characterizes a phase of reversibility during which there is
"virtually" no more remainder. The two propositions are simultaneously "true" and are
not mutually exclusive. They are themselves reversible.
Another aspect as surprising as the absence of an opposing term: the remainder makes
you laugh. Any discussion on this theme unleashes the same language games, the same
ambiguity, and the same obscenity as do discussions of sex or death. Sex and death are
the great themes recognized for unleashing ambivalence and laughter. But the remainder
is the third, and perhaps the only one, the two others amounting to this as to the very
figure of reversibility. For why does one laugh? One only laughs at the reversibility of
things, and sex and death are eminently reversible figures. It is because the stake is
always reversible between masculine and feminine, between life and death, that one
laughs at sex and death. How much more, then, at the remainder, which does not even
have an opposing term, which by itself traverses the whole cycle, and runs infinitely after
its own slash, after its own double, like Peter Schlemihl after his shadow?*l The
remainder is obscene, because it is reversible and is exchanged for itself. It is obscene
and makes one laugh, as only the lack of distinction between masculine and feminine, the
lack of distinction between life and death makes one laugh, deeply laugh.
Today, the remainder has become the weighty term. It is on the remainder that a new
intelligibility is founded. End of a certain logic of distinctive oppositions, in which the
weak term played the role of the residual term. Today, everything is inverted.
Psychoanalysis itself is the first great theorization of residues (lapses, dreams, etc.). It is
no longer a political economy of production that directs us, but an economic politics of
reproduction, of recycling-ecology and pollution-a political economy of the remainder.
All normality sees itself today in the light of madness, which was nothing but its
insignificant remainder. Privilege of all the remainders, in all domains, of the not - said,
the feminine, the crazy, the marginal, of excrement and waste in art, etc. But this is still
nothing but a sort of inversion of the structure, of the return of the repressed as a
powerful moment, of the return of the remainder as surplus of meaning, as excess (but

excess is not formally different from the remainder, and the problem of the squandering
of excess in Bataille is not different from that of the reabsorption of remainders in a
political economy of calculation and penury, only the philosophies are different), of a
higher order of meaning starting with the remainder. The secret of all the "liberations"
that play on the hidden energies on the other side of the slash.
Now we are faced with a much more original situation: not that of the pure and simple
inversion and promotion of remainders, but that of an instability in every structure and
every opposition that makes it so that there is no longer even a remainder, due to the fact
that the remainder is everywhere, and by playing with the slash, it annuls itself as such.
It is not when one has taken everything away that nothing is left, rather, nothing is left
when things are unceasingly shifted and addition itself no longer has any meaning.
Birth is residual if it is not symbolically revisited through initiation.
Death is residual if it is not resolved in mourning, in the collective celebration of
mourning.
Value is residual if it is not reabsorbed and volitalized in the cycle of exchanges.
Sexuality is residual once it becomes the production of sexual relations.
The social itself is residual once it becomes a production of "social relations."
All of the real is residual, and everything that is residual is destined to repeat itself
indefinitely in phantasms.
All accumulation is nothing but a remainder, and the accumulation of remainders, in the
sense that it is a rupture of alliance, and in the linear infinity of accumulation and
calculation, in the linear infinity of production, compensates for the energy and value that
used to be accomplished in the cycle of alliance. Now, what traverses a cycle is
completely realized, whereas in the dimension of the infinite, everything that is below the
line of the infinite, below the line of eternity (this stockpile of time that itself is also, as
with any stockpile, a rupture of alliances), all of that is nothing but the remainder.
Accumulation is nothing but the remainder, and repression is nothing but its inverse and
asymmetrical form. It is on the stockpile of repressed affects and representations that our
new alliance is based.
But when everything is repressed, nothing is anymore. We are not far from this absolute
point of repression where the stockpiles are themselves undone, where the stockpiles of
phantasms collapse. The whole imaginary of the stockpile, of energy, and of what
remains of it, comes to us from repression. When repression reaches a point of critical
saturation where its presence is put in question, then energy will no longer be available to
be liberated, spent, economized, produced: it is the concept of energy itself that will be
volatilized of its own accord.

Today the remainder, the energies left us, the restitution and the conservation of
remainders, is the crucial problem of humanity. It is insoluble in and of itself. All new
freed or spent energy will leave a new remainder. All desire, all libidinal energy, will
produce a new repression. What is surprising in this, given that energy itself is not
conceived except in the movement that stockpiles and liberates it, that represses it and
"produces" it, that is to say in the figure of the remainder and its double?
One must push at the insane consumption of energy in order to exterminate its concept.
One must push at maximal repression in order to exterminate its concept. Once the last
liter of energy has been consumed (by the last ecologist), once the last indigenous person
has been analyzed (by the last ethnologist), once the ultimate commodity has been
produced by the last "work force," then one will realize that this gigantic spiral of energy
and production, of repression and the unconscious, thanks to which one has managed to
enclose everything in an entropic and catastrophic equation, that all this is in effect
nothing but a metaphysics of the remainder, and it will suddenly be resolved in all its
effects.
* NOTE *
1. The allusion to Peter Schlemihl, the Man Who Lost His Shadow, is not accidental.
Since the shadow, like the image in the mirror (in The Student from Prague), is a
remainder par excellence, something that can "fall" from the body, just like hair,
excrement, or nail clippings to which it "is" compared in all archaic magic. But they are
also, one knows, "metaphors" of the soul, of breath, of Being, of essence, of what
profoundly gives meaning to the subject. Without an image or without a shadow, the
body becomes a transparent nothing, it is itself nothing but a remainder. It is the
diaphanous substance that remains once the shadow is gone. There is no more reality: it
is the shadow that has carried all reality away with it (thus in The Student from Prague,
the image broken by the mirror brings with it the immediate death of the hero - classic
sequence of fantastic tales - see also The Shadow by Hans Christian Andersen). Thus the
body can be nothing but the waste product of its own residue, the fallout of its own
fallout. Only the order said to be real permits privileging the body as reference. But
nothing in the symbolic order permits betting on the primacy of one or the other (of the
body or the shadow). And it is this reversion of the shadow onto the body, this fallout of
the essential, by the terms of the essential, under the rubric of the insignificant, this
incessant defeat of meaning before what remains of it, be they nail clippings or the "objet
petit a," that creates the charm, the beauty, and the disquieting strangeness of these
stories.
