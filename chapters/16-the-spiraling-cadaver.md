# THE SPIRALING CADAVER #

The university is in ruins: nonfunctional in the social arenas of the market and
employment, lacking cultural substance or an end purpose of knowledge.
Strictly speaking, there is no longer even any power: it is also in ruins. Whence the
impossibility of the return of the fires of 1968: of the return of putting in question
knowledge versus power itself - the explosive contradiction of knowledge and power (or
the revelation of their collusion, which comes to the same thing) in the university, and, at
the same time, through symbolic (rather than political) contagion in the whole
institutional and social order. Why sociologists? marked this shift: the impasse of
knowledge, the vertigo of nonknowledge (that is to say at once the absurdity and the
impossibility of accumulating value in the order of knowledge) turns like an absolute
weapon against power itself, in order to dismantle it according to the same vertiginous
scenario of dispossession. This is the May 1968 effect. Today it cannot be achieved since
power itself, after knowledge, has taken off, has become ungraspable - has dispossessed
itself. In a now uncertain institution, without knowledge content, without a power
structure (except for an archaic feudalism that turns a simulacrum of a machine whose
destiny escapes it and whose survival is as artificial as that of barracks and theaters),
offensive irruption is impossible. Only what precipitates rotting, by accentuating the
parodic, simulacral side of dying games of knowledge and power, has meaning.
A strike has exactly the opposite effect. It regenerates the ideal of a possible university:
the fiction of an ascension on everyone's part to a culture that is unlocatable, and that no
longer has meaning. This ideal is substituted for the operation of the university as its
critical alternative, as its therapy. This fiction still dreams of a permanency and
democracy of knowledge. Besides, everywhere today the Left plays this role: it is the
justice of the Left that reinjects an idea of justice, the necessity of logic and social morals
into a rotten apparatus that is coming undone, which is losing all conscience of its
legitimacy and renounces functioning almost of its own volition. It is the Left that secrets
and desperately reproduces power, because it wants power, and therefore the Left
believes in it and revives it precisely where the system puts an end to it. The system puts
an end one by one to all its axioms, to all its institutions, and realizes one by one all the
objectives of the historical and revolutionary Left that sees itself constrained to revive the
wheels of capital in order to lay seige to them one day: from private property to the small
business, from the army to national grandeur, from puritan morality to petit bourgeois
culture, justice at the university - everything that is disappearing, that the system itself, in
its atrocity, certainly, but also in its irreversible impulse, has liquidated, must be
conserved.
Whence the paradoxical but necessary inversion of all the terms of political analysis.
Power (or what takes its place) no longer believes in the university. It knows
fundamentally that it is only a zone for the shelter and surveillance of a whole class of a
certain age, it therefore has only to select - it will find its elite elsewhere, or by other
means. Diplomas are worthless: why would it refuse to award them, in any case it is
ready to award them to everybody; why this provocative politics, if not in order to

crystallize energies on a fictive stake (selection, work, diplomas, etc.), on an already dead
and rotting referential?
By rotting, the university can still do a lot of damage (rotting is a symbolic mechanism not political but symbolic, therefore subversive for us). But for this to be the case it is
necessary to start with this very rotting, and not to dream of resurrection. It is necessary
to transform this rotting into a violent process, into violent death, through mockery and
defiance, through a multiplied simulation that would offer the ritual of the death of the
university as a model of decomposition to the whole of society, a contagious model of the
disaffection of a whole social structure, where death would finally make its ravages,
which the strike tries desperately to avert, in complicity with the system, but succeeds, on
top of it all, only in transforming the university into a slow death, a delay that is not even
the possible site of a subversion, of an offensive reversion.
That is what the events of May 1968 produced. At a less advanced point in the process of
the liquefaction of the university and of culture, the students, far from wishing to save the
furniture (revive the lost object, in an ideal mode), retorted by confronting power with the
challenge of the total, immediate death of the institution, the challenge of a
deterritorialization even more intense than the one that came from the system, and by
summoning power to respond to this total derailment of the institution of knowledge, to
this total lack of a need to gather in a given place, this death desired in the end - not the
crisis of the university, that is not a challenge, on the contrary, it is the game of the
system, but the death of the university - to that challenge, power has not been able to
respond, except by its own dissolution in return (only for a moment maybe, but we saw
it).
The barricades of 10 May seemed defensive and to be defending a territory: the Latin
Quarter, old boutique. But this is not true: behind this facade, it was the dead university,
the dead culture whose challenge they were launching at power, and their own eventual
death at the same time - a transformation into immediate sacrifice, which was only the
long-term operation of the system itself: the liquidation of culture and of knowledge.
They were not there to save the Sorbonne, but to brandish its cadaver in the face of the
others, just as black people in Watts and in Detroit brandished the ruins of their
neighborhoods to which they had themselves set fire.
What can one brandish today? No longer even the ruins of knowledge, of culture - the
ruins themselves are defunct. We know it, we have mourned Nanterre for seven years.
1968 is dead, repeatable only as a phantasm of mourning. What would be the equivalent
in symbolic violence (that is to say beyond the political) would be the same operation
that caused nonknowledge, the rotting of knowledge to come up against power - no
longer discovering this fabulous energy on the same level at all, but on the superior
spiral: causing nonpower, the rotting of power to come up against - against what
precisely? There lies the problem. It is perhaps insoluble. Power is being lost, power has
been lost. All around us there are nothing but dummies of power, but the mechanical
illusion of power still rules the social order, behind which grows the absent, illegible,
terror of control, the terror of a definitive code, of which we are the minuscule terminals.
Attacking representation no longer has much meaning either. One senses quite clearly,
for the same reason, that all student conflicts (as is the case, more broadly, on the level of

global society) around the representation, the delegation of power are no longer anything
but phantom vicissitudes that yet still manage, out of despair, to occupy the forefront of
the stage. Through I don't know what Mobius effect, representation itself has also turned
in on itself, and the whole logical universe of the political is dissolved at the same time,
ceding its place to a transfinite universe of simulation, where from the beginning no one
is represented nor representative of anything any more, where all that is accumulated is
deaccumulated at the same time, where even the axiological, directive, and salvageable
phantasm of power has disappeared. A universe that is still incomprehensible,
unrecognizable, to us, a universe with a malefic curve that our mental coordinates, which
are orthogonal and prepared for the infinite linearity of criticism and history, violently
resist. Yet it is there that one must fight, if even fighting has any meaning anymore. We
are simulators, we are simulacra (not in the classical sense of "appearance"), we are
concave mirrors radiated by the social, a radiation without a light source, power without
origin, without distance, and it is in this tactical universe of the simulacrum that one will
need to fight - without hope, hope is a weak value, but in defiance and fascination.
Because one must not refuse the intense fascination that emanates from this liquefaction
of all power, of all axes of value, of all axiology, politics included. This spectacle, which
is at once that of the death throes and the apogee of capital, surpasses by far that of the
commodity described by the situationists. This spectacle is our essential force. We are no
longer in a relation toward capital of uncertain or victorious forces, but in a political one,
that is the phantasm of revolution. We are in a relation of defiance, of seduction, and of
death toward this universe that is no longer one, precisely because all axiality that
escapes it. The challenge capital directs at us in its delirium - liquidating without shame
the law of profit, surplus value, productive finalities, structures of power, and finding at
the end of its process the profound immorality (but also the seduction) of primitive rituals
of destruction, this very challenge must be raised to an insanely higher level. Capital, like
value, is irresponsible, irreversible, ineluctable. Only to value is capital capable of
offering a fantastic spectacle of its decomposition - only the phantom of value still floats
over the desert of the classical structures of capital, just as the phantom of religion floats
over a world now long desacralized, just as the phantom of knowledge floats over the
university. It is up to us to again become the nomads of this desert, but disengaged from
the mechanical illusion of value. We will live in this world, which for us has all the
disquieting strangeness of the desert and of the simulacrum, with all the veracity of living
phantoms, of wandering and simulating animals that capital, that the death of capital has
made of us - because the desert of cities is equal to the desert of sand - the jungle of signs
is equal to that of the forests - the vertigo of simulacra is equal to that of nature - only the
vertiginous seduction of a dying system remains, in which work buries work, in which
value buries value - leaving a virgin, sacred space without pathways, continuous as
Bataille wished it, where only the wind lifts the sand, where only the wind watches over
the sand.
What can one make of all this in the political order? Very little.
But we also have to fight against the profound fascination exerted on us by the death
throes of capital, against the staging by capital of its own death, when we are really the
ones in our final hours. To leave it the initiative of its own death, is to leave it all the
privileges of revolution. Surrounded by the simulacrum of value and by the phantom of
capital and of power, we are much more disarmed and impotent than when surrounded by

the law of value and of the commodity, since the system has revealed itself capable of
integrating its own death and since we are relieved of the responsibility for this death,
and thus of the stake of our own life. This supreme ruse of the system, that of the
simulacrum of its death, through which it maintains us in life by having liquidated
through absorption all possible negativity, only a superior ruse can stop. Challenge or
imaginary science, only a pataphysics of simulacra can can remove us from the system's
strategy of simulation and the impasse of death in which it imprisons us.
