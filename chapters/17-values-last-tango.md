# VALUE'S LAST TANGO #

Where nothing is in its place, lies disorder
Where in the desired place there is nothing, lies order
-Brecht
Panic on the part of university administrators at the idea that diplomas will be awarded
without a "real"-work counterpart, without an equivalence in knowledge. This panic is
not that of political subversion, it is that of seeing value become dissociated from its
contents and begin to function alone, according to its very form. The values of the
university (diplomas, etc.) will proliferate and continue to circulate, a bit like floating
capital or Eurodollars, they will spiral without referential criteria, completely devalorized
in the end, but that is unimportant: their circulation alone is enough to create a social
horizon of value, and the ghostly presence of the phantom value will only be greater,
even when its reference point (its use value, its exchange value, the academic "work
force" that the university recoops) is lost. Terror of value without equivalence.
This situation only appears to be new. It is so for those who still think that a real process
of work takes place in the university, and who invest their lived experience, their
neuroses, their raison d'Ãªtre in it. The exchange of signs (of knowledge, of culture) in the
university, between "teachers" and "taught" has for some time been nothing but a doubled
collusion of bitterness and indifference (the indifference of signs that brings with it the
disaffection of social and human relations), a doubled simulacrum of a psychodrama (that
of a demand hot with shame, presence, oedipal exchange, with pedagogical incest that
strives to substitute itself for the lost exchange of work and knowledge). In this sense the
university remains the site of a desperate initiation to the empty form of value, and those
who have lived there for the past few years are familiar with this strange work, the true
desperation of nonwork, of nonknowledge. Because current generations still dream of
reading, of learning, of competing, but their heart isn't in it - as a whole, the ascetic
cultural mentality has run body and possessions together. This is why the strike no longer
means anything.*l
It is also why we were trapped, we trapped ourselves, after 1968, into giving diplomas to
everybody. Subversion? Not at all. Once again, we were the promoters of the advanced
form, of the pure form of value: diplomas without work. The system does not want any
more diplomas, but it wants that - operational values in the void - and we were the ones
who inaugurated it, with the illusion of doing the opposite.
The students' distress at having diplomas conferred on them for no work complements
and is equal to that of the teachers. It is more secret and more insidious than the
traditional anguish of failure or of receiving worthless diplomas. No-risk insurance on the
diploma - which empties the vicissitudes of knowledge and selection of content - is hard
to bear. Also it must be complicated by either a benefit - alibi, a simulacrum of work
exchanged against a simulacrum of a diploma, or by a form of aggression (the teacher
called on to give the course, or treated as the automatic distributor) or by rancor, so that
at least something will still take place that resembles a "real" relation. But nothing works.
Even the domestic squabbles between teachers and students, which today make up a great

part of their exchanges, are nothing but the recollection of, and a kind of nostalgia for a
violence or a complicity that heretofore made them enemies or united them around a
stake of knowledge or a political stake.
The "hard law of value," the "law set in stone" - when it abandons us, what sadness, what
panic! This is why there are still good days left to fascist and authoritarian methods,
because they revive something of the violence necessary to life - whether suffered or
inflicted. The violence of ritual, the violence of work, the violence of knowledge, the
violence of blood, the violence of power and of the political is good! It is clear, luminous,
the relations of force, contradictions, exploitation, repression! This is lacking today, and
the need for it makes itself felt. The teacher's reinvestment of his power through "free
speech," the self-management of the group and other modern nonsense - it is still all a
game, for example, in the university (but the entire political sphere is articulated in the
same way). No one is fooled. Simply in order to escape profound disillusionment, to
escape the catastrophe brought on by the loss of roles, statutes, responsibilities, and the
incredible demagoguery that is deployed through them, it is necessary to recreate the
professor either as a mannequin of power and knowledge, or to invest him with a
modicum of legitimacy derived from the ultra-Left - if not the situation is intolerable for
everyone. It is based on this compromise - artificial figuration of the teacher, equivocal
complicity on the part of the student - it is based on this phantom scenario of pedagogy
that things continue and this time can last indefinitely. Because there is an end to value
and to work, there is none to the simulacrum of value and of work. The universe of
simulation is transreal and transfmite: no test of reality will come to put an end to it except the total collapse and slippage of the terrain, which remains our most foolish hope.
* Note *
1. Moreover, contemporary strikes naturally take on the same qualities as work: the same
suspension, the same weight, the same absence of objectives, the same allergy to
decisions, the same turning round of power, the same mourning of energy, the same
undefined circularity in todays strike as in yesterday's work, the same situation in the
counterinstitution as in the institution: the contagion grows, the circle is closed - after that
it will be necessary to emerge elsewhere. Or, rather, the opposite: take this impasse itself
as the basic situation, turn the indecision and the absence of an objective into an
offensive situation, a strategy. In searching at any price to wrench oneself from this
mortal situation, from this mental anorexia of the university, the students do nothing but
breathe energy again into an institution long since in a coma; it is forced survival, it is the
medicine of desperation that is practiced today on both institutions and individuals, and
that everywhere is the sign of the same incapacity to confront death. "One must push
what is collapsing," said Nietzsche.
