<h1>The Precession of Simulacra</h1>

<p>If once we were able to view the Borges fable in which the car­tog­ra­phers of the Empire draw up a map so detailed that it ends up cov­er­ing the ter­ri­tory exactly (the decline of the Empire wit­nesses the fray­ing of this map, little by little, and its fall into ruins, though some shreds are still dis­cernible in the deserts—the meta­phys­i­cal beauty of this ruined abstrac­tion tes­ti­fy­ing to a pride equal to the Empire and rot­ting like a car­cass, return­ing to the sub­stance of the soil, a bit as the double ends by being con­fused with the real through aging)—as the most beau­ti­ful alle­gory of sim­u­la­tion, this fable has now come full circle for us, and pos­sesses noth­ing but the dis­crete charm of second-order sim­u­lacra.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
</div>
<p>Today abstrac­tion is no longer that of the map, the double, the mirror, or the con­cept. Sim­u­la­tion is no longer that of a ter­ri­tory, a ref­er­en­tial being, or a sub­stance. It is the gen­er­a­tion by models of a real with­out origin or real­ity: a hyper­real. The ter­ri­tory no longer pre­cedes the map, nor does it sur­vive it. It is nev­er­the­less the map that pre­cedes the ter­ri­tory—<em>pre­ces­sion of sim­u­lacra</em>—that engen­ders the ter­ri­tory, and if one must return to the fable, today it is the ter­ri­tory whose shreds slowly rot across the extent of the map. It is the real, and not the map, whose ves­tiges per­sist here and there in the deserts that are no longer those of the Empire, but ours. <em>The desert of the real itself</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, even inverted, Borges’s fable is unus­able. Only the alle­gory of the Empire, per­haps, remains. Because it is with this same impe­ri­al­ism that present-day sim­u­la­tors attempt to make the real, all of the real, coin­cide with their models of sim­u­la­tion. But it is no longer a ques­tion of either maps or ter­ri­to­ries. Some­thing has dis­ap­peared: the sov­er­eign dif­fer­ence, between one and the other, that con­sti­tuted the charm of abstrac­tion. Because it is dif­fer­ence that con­sti­tutes the poetry of the map and the charm of the ter­ri­tory, the magic of the con­cept and the charm of the real. This imag­i­nary of rep­re­sen­ta­tion, which simul­ta­ne­ously cul­mi­nates in and is engulfed by the car­tog­ra­pher’s mad project of the ideal coex­ten­siv­ity of map and ter­ri­tory, dis­ap­pears in the sim­u­la­tion whose oper­a­tion is nuclear and genetic, no longer at all spec­u­lar or dis­cur­sive. It is all of meta­physics that is lost. No more mirror of being and appear­ances, of the real and its con­cept. No more imag­i­nary coex­ten­siv­ity: it is genetic minia­tur­iza­tion that is the dimen­sion of sim­u­la­tion. The real is pro­duced from minia­tur­ized cells, matri­ces, and memory banks, models of con­trol—and it can be repro­duced an indef­i­nite number of times from these. It no longer needs to be ratio­nal, because it no longer mea­sures itself against either an ideal or neg­a­tive instance. It is no longer any­thing but oper­a­tional. In fact, it is no longer really the real, because no imag­i­nary envelops it any­more. It is a hyper­real, pro­duced from a radi­at­ing syn­the­sis of com­bi­na­tory models in a hyper­space with­out atmos­phere.</p>
<p>By cross­ing into a space whose cur­va­ture is no longer that of the real, nor that of truth, the era of sim­u­la­tion is inau­gu­rated by a liq­ui­da­tion of all ref­er­en­tials—worse: with their arti­fi­cial res­ur­rec­tion in the sys­tems of signs, a mate­rial more mal­leable than mean­ing, in that it lends itself to all sys­tems of equiv­a­lences, to all binary oppo­si­tions, to all com­bi­na­tory alge­bra. It is no longer a ques­tion of imi­ta­tion, nor dupli­ca­tion, nor even parody. It is a ques­tion of sub­sti­tut­ing the signs of the real for the real, that is to say of an oper­a­tion of deter­ring every real process via its oper­a­tional double, a pro­gram­matic, metastable, per­fectly descrip­tive machine that offers all the signs of the real and short-cir­cuits all its vicis­si­tudes. Never again will the real have the chance to pro­duce itself such is the vital func­tion of the model in a system of death, or rather of antic­i­pated res­ur­rec­tion, that no longer even gives the event of death a chance. A hyper­real hence­forth shel­tered from the imag­i­nary, and from any dis­tinc­tion between the real and the imag­i­nary, leav­ing room only for the orbital recur­rence of models and for the sim­u­lated gen­er­a­tion of dif­fer­ences.</p>

<h2>The Divine Irreference of Images</h2>
<div class="noindent">
<p>To dis­sim­u­late is to pre­tend not to have what one has. To sim­u­late is to feign to have what one doesn’t have. One implies a pres­ence, the other an absence. But it is more com­pli­cated than that because sim­u­lat­ing is not pre­tend­ing: “Who­ever fakes an ill­ness can simply stay in bed and make every­one believe he is ill. Who­ever sim­u­lates an ill­ness pro­duces in him­self some of the symp­toms” (Littré). There­fore, pre­tend­ing, or dis­sim­u­lat­ing, leaves the prin­ci­ple of real­ity intact: the dif­fer­ence is always clear, it is simply masked, whereas sim­u­la­tion threat­ens the dif­fer­ence between the “true” and the “false,” the “real” and the “imag­i­nary.” Is the sim­u­la­tor sick or not, given that he pro­duces “true” symp­toms? Objec­tively one cannot treat him as being either ill or not ill. Psy­chol­ogy and medicine stop at this point, fore­stalled by the ill­ness’s hence­forth undis­cov­er­able truth. For if any symp­tom can be “pro­duced,” and can no longer be taken as a fact of nature, then every ill­ness can be con­sid­ered as sim­u­lat­able and sim­u­lated, and medicine loses its mean­ing since it only knows how to treat “real” ill­nesses accord­ing to their objec­tive causes. Psy­cho­so­mat­ics evolves in a dubi­ous manner at the bor­ders of the prin­ci­ple of ill­ness. As to psy­cho­anal­y­sis, it trans­fers the symp­tom of the organic order to the uncon­scious order: the latter is new and taken for “real” more real than the other—but why would sim­u­la­tion be at the gates of the uncon­scious? Why couldn’t the “work” of the uncon­scious be “pro­duced” in the same way as any old symp­tom of clas­si­cal medicine? Dreams already are.</p>
</div>
<p>Cer­tainly, the psy­chi­a­trist pur­ports that “for every form of mental alien­ation there is a par­tic­u­lar order in the suc­ces­sion of symp­toms of which the sim­u­la­tor is igno­rant and in the absence of which the psy­chi­a­trist would not be deceived.” This (which dates from 1865) in order to safe­guard the prin­ci­ple of a truth at all costs and to escape the inter­ro­ga­tion posed by sim­u­la­tion—the knowl­edge that truth, ref­er­ence, objec­tive cause have ceased to exist. Now, what can medicine do with what floats on either side of ill­ness, on either side of health, with the dupli­ca­tion of ill­ness in a dis­course that is no longer either true or false? What can psy­cho­anal­y­sis do with the dupli­ca­tion of the dis­course of the uncon­scious in the dis­course of sim­u­la­tion that can never again be unmasked, since it is not false either?<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>What can the army do about sim­u­la­tors? Tra­di­tion­ally it unmasks them and pun­ishes them, accord­ing to a clear prin­ci­ple of iden­ti­fi­ca­tion. Today it can dis­charge a very good sim­u­la­tor as exactly equiv­a­lent to a “real” homo­sex­ual, a heart patient, or a madman. Even mil­i­tary psy­chol­ogy draws back from Carte­sian cer­tain­ties and hes­i­tates to make the dis­tinc­tion between true and false, between the “pro­duced” and the authen­tic symp­tom. “If he is this good at acting crazy, it’s because he is.” Nor is mil­i­tary psy­chol­ogy mis­taken in this regard: in this sense, all crazy people sim­u­late, and this lack of dis­tinc­tion is the worst kind of sub­ver­sion.</p>
<p>It is against this lack of dis­tinc­tion that clas­si­cal reason armed itself in all its cat­e­gories. But it is what today again out­flanks them, sub­merg­ing the prin­ci­ple of truth.</p>
<p>Beyond medicine and the army favored ter­rains of sim­u­la­tion, the ques­tion returns to reli­gion and the sim­u­lacrum of divin­ity: “I for­bade that there be any sim­u­lacra in the tem­ples because the divin­ity that ani­mates nature can never be rep­re­sented.” Indeed it can be. But what becomes of the divin­ity when it reveals itself in icons, when it is mul­ti­plied in sim­u­lacra? Does it remain the supreme power that is simply incar­nated in images as a vis­i­ble the­ol­ogy? Or does it volatilize itself in the sim­u­lacra that, alone, deploy their power and pomp of fas­ci­na­tion—the vis­i­ble machin­ery of icons sub­sti­tuted for the pure and intel­li­gi­ble Idea of God? This is pre­cisely what was feared by Icon­o­clasts, whose mil­len­nial quar­rel is still with us today.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> This is pre­cisely because they pre­dicted this omnipo­tence of sim­u­lacra, the fac­ulty sim­u­lacra have of effac­ing God from the con­science of man, and the destruc­tive, anni­hi­lat­ing truth that they allow to appear—that deep down God never existed, that only the sim­u­lacrum ever existed, even that God him­self was never any­thing but his own sim­u­lacrum—from this came their urge to destroy the images. If they could have believed that these images only obfus­cated or masked the Pla­tonic Idea of God, there would have been no reason to destroy them. One can live with the idea of dis­torted truth. But their meta­phys­i­cal despair came from the idea that the image didn’t con­ceal any­thing at all, and that these images were in essence not images, such as an orig­i­nal model would have made them, but per­fect sim­u­lacra, for­ever radi­ant with their own fas­ci­na­tion. Thus this death of the divine ref­er­en­tial must be exor­cised at all costs.</p>
<p>One can see that the icon­o­clasts, whom one accuses of dis­dain­ing and negat­ing images, were those who accorded them their true value, in con­trast to the icono­laters who only saw reflec­tions in them and were con­tent to ven­er­ate a fil­i­gree God. On the other hand, one can say that the icon wor­shipers were the most modern minds, the most adven­tur­ous, because, in the guise of having God become appar­ent in the mirror of images, they were already enact­ing his death and his dis­ap­pear­ance in the epiphany of his rep­re­sen­ta­tions (which, per­haps, they already knew no longer rep­re­sented any­thing, that they were purely a game, but that it was therein the great game lay—know­ing also that it is dan­ger­ous to unmask images, since they dis­sim­u­late the fact that there is noth­ing behind them).</p>
<p>This was the approach of the Jesuits, who founded their pol­i­tics on the vir­tual dis­ap­pear­ance of God and on the worldly and spec­tac­u­lar manip­u­la­tion of con­sciences—the evanes­cence of God in the epiphany of power—the end of tran­scen­dence, which now only serves as an alibi for a strat­egy alto­gether free of influ­ences and signs. Behind the baro­que­ness of images hides the émi­nence grise of pol­i­tics.</p>
<p>This way the stake will always have been the mur­der­ous power of images, mur­der­ers of the real, mur­der­ers of their own model, as the Byzan­tine icons could be those of divine iden­tity. To this mur­der­ous power is opposed that of rep­re­sen­ta­tions as a dialec­ti­cal power, the vis­i­ble and intel­li­gi­ble medi­a­tion of the Real. All West­ern faith and good faith became engaged in this wager on rep­re­sen­ta­tion: that a sign could refer to the depth of mean­ing, that a sign could be exchanged for mean­ing and that some­thing could guar­an­tee this exchange—God of course. But what if God him­self can be sim­u­lated, that is to say can be reduced to the signs that con­sti­tute faith? Then the whole system becomes weight­less, it is no longer itself any­thing but a gigan­tic sim­u­lacrum—not unreal, but a sim­u­lacrum, that is to say never exchanged for the real, but exchanged for itself, in an unin­ter­rupted cir­cuit with­out ref­er­ence or cir­cum­fer­ence.</p>
<p>Such is sim­u­la­tion, inso­far as it is opposed to rep­re­sen­ta­tion. Rep­re­sen­ta­tion stems from the prin­ci­ple of the equiv­a­lence of the sign and of the real (even if this equiv­a­lence is utopian, it is a fun­da­men­tal axiom). Sim­u­la­tion, on the con­trary, stems from the utopia of the prin­ci­ple of equiv­a­lence, <em>from the rad­i­cal nega­tion of the sign as value</em>, from the sign as the rever­sion and death sen­tence of every ref­er­ence. Whereas rep­re­sen­ta­tion attempts to absorb sim­u­la­tion by inter­pret­ing it as a false rep­re­sen­ta­tion, sim­u­la­tion envelops the whole edi­fice of rep­re­sen­ta­tion itself as a sim­u­lacrum.</p>
<p>Such would be the suc­ces­sive phases of the image:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is the reflection of a profound reality;<br />
</li>
<li>it masks and denatures a profound reality;<br />
</li>
<li>it masks the absence of a profound reality;<br />
</li>
<li>it has no relation to any reality whatsoever: it is its own pure simulacrum.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the first case, the image is a <em>good</em> appear­ance—rep­re­sen­ta­tion is of the sacra­men­tal order. In the second, it is an evil appear­ance—it is of the order of malef­i­cence. In the third, it plays at being an appear­ance—it is of the order of sor­cery. In the fourth, it is no longer of the order of appear­ances, but of sim­u­la­tion.</p>
<p>The tran­si­tion from signs that dis­sim­u­late some­thing to signs that dis­sim­u­late that there is noth­ing marks a deci­sive turn­ing point. The first reflects a the­ol­ogy of truth and secrecy (to which the notion of ide­ol­ogy still belongs). The second inau­gu­rates the era of sim­u­lacra and of sim­u­la­tion, in which there is no longer a God to rec­og­nize his own, no longer a Last Judg­ment to sep­a­rate the false from the true, the real from its arti­fi­cial res­ur­rec­tion, as every­thing is already dead and res­ur­rected in advance.</p>
<p>When the real is no longer what it was, nos­tal­gia assumes its full mean­ing. There is a plethora of myths of origin and of signs of real­ity—a plethora of truth, of sec­ondary objec­tiv­ity, and authen­tic­ity. Esca­la­tion of the true, of lived expe­ri­ence, res­ur­rec­tion of the fig­u­ra­tive where the object and sub­stance have dis­ap­peared. Panic-stricken pro­duc­tion of the real and of the ref­er­en­tial, par­al­lel to and greater than the panic of mate­rial pro­duc­tion: this is how sim­u­la­tion appears in the phase that con­cerns us—a strat­egy of the real, of the neo­real and the hyper­real that every­where is the double of a strat­egy of deter­rence.</p>

<h2>Ramses, or the Rosy-Colored Resurrection</h2>
<div class="noindent">
<p>Eth­nol­ogy brushed up against its para­dox­i­cal death in 1971, the day when the Philip­pine gov­ern­ment decided to return the few dozen Tasa­day who had just been dis­cov­ered in the depths of the jungle, where they had lived for eight cen­turies with­out any con­tact with the rest of the species, to their prim­i­tive state, out of the reach of col­o­niz­ers, tourists, and eth­nol­o­gists. This at the sug­ges­tion of the anthro­pol­o­gists them­selves, who were seeing the indige­nous people dis­in­te­grate imme­di­ately upon con­tact, like mum­mies in the open air.</p>
</div>
<p>In order for eth­nol­ogy to live, its object must die; by dying, the object takes its revenge for being “dis­cov­ered” and with its death defies the sci­ence that wants to grasp it.</p>
<p>Doesn’t all sci­ence live on this para­dox­i­cal slope to which it is doomed by the evanes­cence of its object in its very appre­hen­sion, and by the piti­less rever­sal that the dead object exerts on it? Like Orpheus, it always turns around too soon, and, like Eury­dice, its object falls back into Hades.</p>
<p>It is against this hell of the para­dox that the eth­nol­o­gists wished to pro­tect them­selves by cor­don­ing off the Tasa­day with virgin forest. No one can touch them any­more: as in a mine the vein is closed down. Sci­ence loses pre­cious cap­i­tal there, but the object will be safe, lost to sci­ence, but intact in its “vir­gin­ity.” It is not a ques­tion of sac­ri­fice (sci­ence never sac­ri­fices itself, it is always mur­der­ous), but of the sim­u­lated sac­ri­fice of its object in order to save its real­ity prin­ci­ple. The Tasa­day, frozen in their nat­u­ral ele­ment, will pro­vide a per­fect alibi, an eter­nal guar­an­tee. Here begins an anti­eth­nol­ogy that will never end and to which Jaulin, Cas­taneda, Clas­tres are var­i­ous wit­nesses. In any case, the log­i­cal evo­lu­tion of a sci­ence is to dis­tance itself increas­ingly from its object, until it dis­penses with it entirely: its auton­omy is only ren­dered even more fan­tas­tic—it attains its pure form.</p>
<p>The Indian thus returned to the ghetto, in the glass coffin of the virgin forest, again becomes the model of sim­u­la­tion of all the pos­si­ble Indi­ans <em>from before eth­nol­ogy</em>. This model thus grants itself the luxury to incar­nate itself beyond itself in the “brute” real­ity of these Indi­ans it has entirely rein­vented—Sav­ages who are indebted to eth­nol­ogy for still being Sav­ages: what a turn of events, what a tri­umph for this sci­ence that seemed ded­i­cated to their destruc­tion!</p>
<p>Of course, these sav­ages are post­hu­mous: frozen, cryo­g­e­nized, ster­il­ized, pro­tected to death, they have become ref­er­en­tial sim­u­lacra, and sci­ence itself has become pure sim­u­la­tion. The same holds true at Crue­sot, at the level of the “open” museum where one muse­u­mi­fied in situ, as “his­tor­i­cal” wit­nesses of their period, entire work­ing-class neigh­bor­hoods, living met­al­lur­gic zones, an entire cul­ture, men, women, and chil­dren included—ges­tures, lan­guages, cus­toms fos­silized alive as in a snap­shot. The museum, instead of being cir­cum­scribed as a geo­met­ric site, is every­where now, like a dimen­sion of life. Thus eth­nol­ogy, rather than cir­cum­scrib­ing itself as an objec­tive sci­ence, will today, lib­er­ated from its object, be applied to all living things and make itself invis­i­ble, like an omnipresent fourth dimen­sion, that of the sim­u­lacrum. <em>We are all Tasa­days</em>, Indi­ans who have again become what they were—sim­u­lacral Indi­ans who at last pro­claim the uni­ver­sal truth of eth­nol­ogy.</p>
<p>We have all become living spec­i­mens in the spec­tral light of eth­nol­ogy, or of anti­eth­nol­ogy, which is noth­ing but the pure form of tri­umphal eth­nol­ogy, under the sign of dead dif­fer­ences, and of the res­ur­rec­tion of dif­fer­ences. It is thus very naive to look for eth­nol­ogy in the Sav­ages or in some Third World—it is here, every­where, in the metrop­o­lises, in the White com­mu­nity, in a world com­pletely cat­a­loged and ana­lyzed, then <em>arti­fi­cially res­ur­rected under the aus­pices of the real</em>, in a world of sim­u­la­tion, of the hal­lu­ci­na­tion of truth, of the black­mail of the real, of the murder of every sym­bolic form and of its hys­ter­i­cal, his­tor­i­cal ret­ro­spec­tion—a murder of which the Sav­ages, noblesse oblige, were the first vic­tims, but that for a long time has extended to all West­ern soci­eties.</p>
<p>But in the same breath eth­nol­ogy grants us its only and final lesson, the secret that kills it (and which the Sav­ages knew better than it did): the vengeance of the dead.</p>
<p>The con­fine­ment of the sci­en­tific object is equal to the con­fine­ment of the mad and the dead. And just as all of soci­ety is irre­me­di­a­bly con­tam­i­nated by this mirror of mad­ness that it has held up to itself, sci­ence can’t help but die con­tam­i­nated by the death of this object that is its inverse mirror. It is sci­ence that mas­ters the objects, but it is the objects that invest it with depth, accord­ing to an uncon­scious rever­sion, which only gives a dead and cir­cu­lar response to a dead and cir­cu­lar inter­ro­ga­tion.</p>
<p>Noth­ing changes when soci­ety breaks the mirror of mad­ness (abol­ishes the asy­lums, gives speech back to the insane, etc.) nor when sci­ence seems to break the mirror of its objec­tiv­ity (effac­ing itself before its object, as in Cas­taneda, etc.) and to bend down before the “dif­fer­ences.” The form pro­duced by con­fine­ment is fol­lowed by an innu­mer­able, diffracted, slowed-down mech­a­nism. As eth­nol­ogy col­lapses in its clas­si­cal insti­tu­tion, it sur­vives in an anti­eth­nol­ogy whose task it is to rein­ject the dif­fer­ence fic­tion, the Savage fic­tion every­where, to con­ceal that it is this world, ours, which has again become savage in its way, that is to say, which is dev­as­tated by dif­fer­ence and by death.</p>
<p>In the same way, with the pre­text of saving the orig­i­nal, one for­bade vis­i­tors to enter the Las­caux caves, but an exact replica was con­structed five hun­dred meters from it, so that every­one could see them (one glances through a peep­hole at the authen­tic cave, and then one visits the recon­sti­tuted whole). It is pos­si­ble that the memory of the orig­i­nal grot­toes is itself stamped in the minds of future gen­er­a­tions, but from now on there is no longer any dif­fer­ence: the dupli­ca­tion suf­fices to render both arti­fi­cial.</p>
<p>In the same way sci­ence and tech­nol­ogy were recently mobi­lized to save the mummy of Ramses II, after it was left to rot for sev­eral dozen years in the depths of a museum. The West is seized with panic at the thought of not being able to save what the sym­bolic order had been able to con­serve for forty cen­turies, but out of sight and far from the light of day. Ramses does not sig­nify any­thing for us, only the mummy is of an ines­timable worth because it is what guar­an­tees that accu­mu­la­tion has mean­ing. Our entire linear and accu­mu­la­tive cul­ture col­lapses if we cannot stock­pile the past in plain view. To this end the pharaohs must be brought out of their tomb and the mum­mies out of their silence. To this end they must be exhumed and given mil­i­tary honors. They are prey to both sci­ence and worms. Only abso­lute secrecy assured them this mil­len­nial power—the mas­tery over putre­fac­tion that sig­ni­fied the mas­tery of the com­plete cycle of exchanges with death. We only know how to place our sci­ence in ser­vice of <em>repair­ing</em> the mummy, that is to say restor­ing a <em>vis­i­ble</em> order, whereas embalm­ing was a myth­i­cal effort that strove to immor­tal­ize a <em>hidden</em> dimen­sion.</p>
<p>We require a vis­i­ble past, a vis­i­ble con­tin­uum, a vis­i­ble myth of origin, which reas­sures us about our end. Because finally we have never believed in them. Whence this his­toric scene of the recep­tion of the mummy at the Orly air­port. Why? Because Ramses was a great despotic and mil­i­tary figure? Cer­tainly. But mostly because our cul­ture dreams, behind this defunct power that it tries to annex, of an order that would have had noth­ing to do with it, and it dreams of it because it exter­mi­nated it by exhum­ing it <em>as its own past</em>.</p>
<p>We are fas­ci­nated by Ramses as Renais­sance Chris­tians were by the Amer­i­can Indi­ans, those (human?) beings who had never known the word of Christ. Thus, at the begin­ning of col­o­niza­tion, there was a moment of stupor and bewil­der­ment before the very pos­si­bil­ity of escap­ing the uni­ver­sal law of the Gospel. There were two pos­si­ble responses: either admit that this Law was not uni­ver­sal, or exter­mi­nate the Indi­ans to efface the evi­dence. In gen­eral, one con­tented one­self with con­vert­ing them, or even simply dis­cov­er­ing them, which would suf­fice to slowly exter­mi­nate them.</p>
<p>Thus it would have been enough to exhume Ramses to ensure his exter­mi­na­tion by muse­u­mi­fi­ca­tion. Because mum­mies don’t rot from worms: they die from being trans­planted from a slow order of the sym­bolic, master over putre­fac­tion and death, to an order of his­tory, sci­ence, and muse­ums, our order, which no longer mas­ters any­thing, which only knows how to con­demn what pre­ceded it to decay and death and sub­se­quently to try to revive it with sci­ence. Irrepara­ble vio­lence toward all secrets, the vio­lence of a civ­i­liza­tion with­out secrets, hatred of a whole civ­i­liza­tion for its own foun­da­tion.</p>
<p>And just as with eth­nol­ogy, which plays at extri­cat­ing itself from its object to better secure itself in its pure form, <em>demu­se­u­mi­fi­ca­tion</em> is noth­ing but another spiral in arti­fi­cial­ity. Wit­ness the clois­ter of Saint-Michel de Cuxa, which one will repa­tri­ate at great cost from the Clois­ters in New York to rein­stall it in “its orig­i­nal site.” And every­one is sup­posed to applaud this resti­tu­tion (as they did “the exper­i­men­tal cam­paign to take back the side­walks” on the Champs Ely­sees!). Well, if the expor­ta­tion of the cor­nices was in effect an arbi­trary act, if the Clois­ters in New York are an arti­fi­cial mosaic of all cul­tures (fol­low­ing a logic of the cap­i­tal­ist cen­tral­iza­tion of value), their reim­por­ta­tion to the orig­i­nal site is even more arti­fi­cial: it is a total sim­u­lacrum that links up with “real­ity” through a com­plete cir­cum­vo­lu­tion.</p>
<p>The clois­ter should have stayed in New York in its sim­u­lated envi­ron­ment, which at least fooled no one. Repa­tri­at­ing it is noth­ing but a sup­ple­men­tary sub­terfuge, acting as if noth­ing had hap­pened and indulging in ret­ro­spec­tive hal­lu­ci­na­tion.</p>
<p>In the same way, Amer­i­cans flat­ter them­selves for having brought the pop­u­la­tion of Indi­ans back to pre-Con­quest levels. One effaces every­thing and starts over. They even flat­ter them­selves for doing better, for exceed­ing the orig­i­nal number. This is pre­sented as proof of the supe­ri­or­ity of civ­i­liza­tion: it will pro­duce more Indi­ans than they them­selves were able to do. (With sin­is­ter deri­sion, this over­pro­duc­tion is again a means of destroy­ing them: for Indian cul­ture, like all tribal cul­ture, rests on the lim­i­ta­tion of the group and the refusal of any “unlim­ited” increase, as can be seen in Ishi’s case. In this way, their demo­graphic “pro­mo­tion” is just another step toward sym­bolic exter­mi­na­tion.)</p>
<p>Every­where we live in a uni­verse strangely sim­i­lar to the orig­i­nal—things are dou­bled by their own sce­nario. But this dou­bling does not sig­nify, as it did tra­di­tion­ally, the immi­nence of their death—they are already purged of their death, and better than when they were alive; more cheer­ful, more authen­tic, in the light of their model, like the faces in funeral homes.</p>

<h2>The Hyperreal and the Imaginary</h2>
<div class="noindent">
<p>Dis­ney­land is a per­fect model of all the entan­gled orders of sim­u­lacra. It is first of all a play of illu­sions and phan­tasms: the Pirates, the Fron­tier, the Future World, etc. This imag­i­nary world is sup­posed to ensure the suc­cess of the oper­a­tion. But what attracts the crowds the most is with­out a doubt the social micro­cosm, the <em>reli­gious</em>, minia­tur­ized plea­sure of real Amer­ica, of its con­straints and joys. One parks out­side and stands in line inside, one is alto­gether aban­doned at the exit. The only phan­tas­mago­ria in this imag­i­nary world lies in the ten­der­ness and warmth of the crowd, and in the suf­fi­cient and exces­sive number of gad­gets nec­es­sary to create the mul­ti­tudi­nous effect. The con­trast with the abso­lute soli­tude of the park­ing lot—a ver­i­ta­ble con­cen­tra­tion camp—is total. Or, rather: inside, a whole panoply of gad­gets mag­ne­tizes the crowd in directed flows—out­side, soli­tude is directed at a single gadget: the auto­mo­bile. By an extra­or­di­nary coin­ci­dence (but this derives with­out a doubt from the enchant­ment inher­ent to this uni­verse), this frozen, child­like world is found to have been con­ceived and real­ized by a man who is him­self now cryo­g­e­nized: Walt Disney, who awaits his res­ur­rec­tion through an increase of 180 degrees centi­grade.</p>
</div>
<p>Thus, every­where in Dis­ney­land the objec­tive pro­file of Amer­ica, down to the mor­phol­ogy of indi­vid­u­als and of the crowd, is drawn. All its values are exalted by the minia­ture and the comic strip. Embalmed and paci­fied. Whence the pos­si­bil­ity of an ide­o­log­i­cal anal­y­sis of Dis­ney­land (L. Marin did it very well in <em>Utopiques, jeux d’espace</em> [Utopias, play of space]): digest of the Amer­i­can way of life, pan­e­gyric of Amer­i­can values, ide­al­ized trans­po­si­tion of a con­tra­dic­tory real­ity. Cer­tainly. But this masks some­thing else and this “ide­o­log­i­cal” blan­ket func­tions as a cover for a <em>sim­u­la­tion of the third order</em>: Dis­ney­land exists in order to hide that it is the “real” coun­try, all of “real” Amer­ica that is Dis­ney­land (a bit like pris­ons are there to hide that it is the social in its entirety, in its banal omnipres­ence, that is carceral). Dis­ney­land is pre­sented as imag­i­nary in order to make us believe that the rest is real, whereas all of Los Ange­les and the Amer­ica that sur­rounds it are no longer real, but belong to the hyper­real order and to the order of sim­u­la­tion. It is no longer a ques­tion of a false rep­re­sen­ta­tion of real­ity (ide­ol­ogy) but of con­ceal­ing the fact that the real is no longer real, and thus of saving the real­ity prin­ci­ple.</p>
<p>The imag­i­nary of Dis­ney­land is nei­ther true nor false, it is a deter­rence machine set up in order to reju­ve­nate the fic­tion of the real in the oppo­site camp. Whence the debil­ity of this imag­i­nary, its infan­tile degen­er­a­tion. This world wants to be child­ish in order to make us believe that the adults are else­where, in the “real” world, and to con­ceal the fact that true child­ish­ness is every­where—that it is that of the adults them­selves who come here to act the child in order to foster illu­sions as to their real child­ish­ness.</p>
<p>Dis­ney­land is not the only one, how­ever. Enchanted Vil­lage, Magic Moun­tain, Marine World: Los Ange­les is sur­rounded by these imag­i­nary sta­tions that feed real­ity, the energy of the real to a city whose mys­tery is pre­cisely that of no longer being any­thing but a net­work of inces­sant, unreal cir­cu­la­tion—a city of incred­i­ble pro­por­tions but with­out space, with­out dimen­sion. As much as elec­tri­cal and atomic power sta­tions, as much as cinema stu­dios, this city, which is no longer any­thing but an immense sce­nario and a per­pet­ual pan shot, needs this old imag­i­nary like a sym­pa­thetic ner­vous system made up of child­hood sig­nals and faked phan­tasms.</p>
<p>Dis­ney­land: a space of the regen­er­a­tion of the imag­i­nary as waste-treat­ment plants are else­where, and even here. Every­where today one must recy­cle waste, and the dreams, the phan­tasms, the his­tor­i­cal, fairy­like, leg­endary imag­i­nary of chil­dren and adults is a waste prod­uct, the first great toxic excre­ment of a hyper­real civ­i­liza­tion. On a mental level, Dis­ney­land is the pro­to­type of this new func­tion. But all the sexual, psy­chic, somatic recy­cling insti­tutes, which pro­lif­er­ate in Cal­i­for­nia, belong to the same order. People no longer look at each other, but there are insti­tutes for that. They no longer touch each other, but there is con­tac­tother­apy. They no longer walk, but they go jog­ging, etc. Every­where one recy­cles lost fac­ul­ties, or lost bodies, or lost social­ity, or the lost taste for food. One rein­vents penury, asceti­cism, van­ished savage nat­u­ral­ness: nat­u­ral food, health food, yoga. Mar­shall Sahlins’s idea that it is the econ­omy of the market, and not of nature at all, that secretes penury, is ver­i­fied, but at a sec­ondary level: here, in the sophis­ti­cated con­fines of a tri­umphal market econ­omy is rein­vented a penury/sign, a penury/sim­u­lacrum, a sim­u­lated behav­ior of the under­de­vel­oped (includ­ing the adop­tion of Marx­ist tenets) that, in the guise of ecol­ogy, of energy crises and the cri­tique of cap­i­tal, adds a final eso­teric aure­ole to the tri­umph of an eso­teric cul­ture. Nev­er­the­less, maybe a mental catas­tro­phe, a mental implo­sion and invo­lu­tion with­out prece­dent lies in wait for a system of this kind, whose vis­i­ble signs would be those of this strange obe­sity, or the incred­i­ble coex­is­tence of the most bizarre the­o­ries and prac­tices, which cor­re­spond to the improb­a­ble coali­tion of luxury, heaven, and money, to the improb­a­ble lux­u­ri­ous mate­ri­al­iza­tion of life and to undis­cov­er­able con­tra­dic­tions.</p>

<section id="political-incantation" class="level2">
<h2>Political Incantation</h2>
<div class="noindent">
<p>Water­gate. The same sce­nario as in Dis­ney­land (effect of the imag­i­nary con­ceal­ing that real­ity no more exists out­side than inside the limits of the arti­fi­cial perime­ter): here the scan­dal effect hiding that there is no dif­fer­ence between the facts and their denun­ci­a­tion (iden­ti­cal meth­ods on the part of the CIA and of the <em>Wash­ing­ton Post</em> jour­nal­ists). Same oper­a­tion, tend­ing to regen­er­ate through scan­dal a moral and polit­i­cal prin­ci­ple, through the imag­i­nary, a sink­ing real­ity prin­ci­ple.</p>
</div>
<p>The denun­ci­a­tion of scan­dal is always an homage to the law. And Water­gate in par­tic­u­lar suc­ceeded in impos­ing the idea that Water­gate was a scan­dal—in this sense it was a prodi­gious oper­a­tion of intox­i­ca­tion. A large dose of polit­i­cal moral­ity rein­jected on a world scale. One could say along with Bour­dieu: “The essence of every rela­tion of force is to dis­sim­u­late itself as such and to acquire all its force only because it dis­sim­u­lates itself as such,” under­stood as fol­lows: cap­i­tal, immoral and with­out scru­ples, can only func­tion behind a moral super­struc­ture, and who­ever revives this public moral­ity (through indig­na­tion, denun­ci­a­tion, etc.) works spon­ta­neously for the order of cap­i­tal. This is what the jour­nal­ists of the <em>Wash­ing­ton Post</em> did.</p>
<p>But this would be noth­ing but the for­mula of ide­ol­ogy, and when Bour­dieu states it, he takes the “rela­tion of force” for the <em>truth</em> of cap­i­tal­ist dom­i­na­tion, and he him­self <em>denounces</em> this rela­tion of force as <em>scan­dal</em>—he is thus in the same deter­min­is­tic and moral­is­tic posi­tion as the <em>Wash­ing­ton Post</em> jour­nal­ists are. He does the same work of purg­ing and reviv­ing moral order, an order of truth in which the ver­i­ta­ble sym­bolic vio­lence of the social order is engen­dered, well beyond all the rela­tions of force, which are only its shift­ing and indif­fer­ent con­fig­u­ra­tion in the moral and polit­i­cal con­sciences of men.</p>
<p>All that cap­i­tal asks of us is to receive it as ratio­nal or to combat it in the name of ratio­nal­ity, to receive it as moral or to combat it in the name of moral­ity. Because <em>these are the same</em>, which <em>can be thought of in another way</em>: for­merly one worked to dis­sim­u­late scan­dal—today one works to con­ceal that there is none.</p>
<p><em>Water­gate is not a scan­dal</em>, this is what must be said at all costs, because it is what every­one is busy con­ceal­ing, this dis­sim­u­la­tion mask­ing a strength­en­ing of moral­ity, of a moral panic as one approaches the prim­i­tive <em>(mise en) scène</em> of cap­i­tal: its instan­ta­neous cru­elty, its incom­pre­hen­si­ble feroc­ity, its fun­da­men­tal immoral­ity—that is what is scan­dalous, unac­cept­able to the system of moral and eco­nomic equiv­a­lence that is the axiom of left­ist thought, from the the­o­ries of the Enlight­en­ment up to Com­mu­nism. One imputes this think­ing to the con­tract of cap­i­tal, but it doesn’t give a damn—it is a mon­strous unprin­ci­pled enter­prise, noth­ing more. It is “enlight­ened” thought that seeks to con­trol it by impos­ing rules on it. And all the recrim­i­na­tion that replaces rev­o­lu­tion­ary thought today comes back to incrim­i­nate cap­i­tal for not fol­low­ing the rules of the game. “Power is unjust, its jus­tice is a class jus­tice, cap­i­tal exploits us, etc.”—as if cap­i­tal were linked by a con­tract to the soci­ety it rules. It is the Left that holds out the mirror of equiv­a­lence to cap­i­tal hoping that it will comply, comply with this phan­tas­mago­ria of the social con­tract and ful­fill its obli­ga­tions to the whole of soci­ety (by the same token, no need for rev­o­lu­tion: it suf­fices that cap­i­tal accom­mo­date itself to the ratio­nal for­mula of exchange).</p>
<p>Cap­i­tal, in fact, was never linked by a con­tract to the soci­ety that it dom­i­nates. It is a sor­cery of social rela­tions, it is a <em>chal­lenge to soci­ety</em>, and it must be responded to as such. It is not a scan­dal to be denounced accord­ing to moral or eco­nomic ratio­nal­ity, but a chal­lenge to take up accord­ing to sym­bolic law.</p>

<h2>Möbius-Spiraling Negativity</h2>
<div class="noindent">
<p>Water­gate was thus noth­ing but a lure held out by the system to catch its adver­saries—a sim­u­la­tion of scan­dal for regen­er­a­tive ends. In the film, this is embod­ied by the char­ac­ter of “Deep Throat,” who was said to be the émi­nence grise of the Repub­li­cans, manip­u­lat­ing the left-wing jour­nal­ists in order to get rid of Nixon—and why not? All hypothe­ses are pos­si­ble, but this one is super­flu­ous: the Left itself does a per­fectly good job, and spon­ta­neously, of doing the work of the Right. Besides, it would be naive to see an embit­tered good con­science at work here. Because manip­u­la­tion is a waver­ing causal­ity in which pos­i­tiv­ity and neg­a­tiv­ity are engen­dered and over­lap, in which there is no longer either an active or a pas­sive. It is through the <em>arbi­trary</em> ces­sa­tion of this spi­ral­ing causal­ity that a prin­ci­ple of polit­i­cal real­ity can be saved. It is through the <em>sim­u­la­tion</em> of a narrow, con­ven­tional field of per­spec­tive in which the premises and the con­se­quences of an act or of an event can be cal­cu­lated, that a polit­i­cal cred­i­bil­ity can be main­tained (and of course “objec­tive” anal­y­sis, the strug­gle, etc.). If one envi­sions the entire cycle of any act or event in a system where linear con­ti­nu­ity and dialec­ti­cal polar­ity no longer exist, in a field <em>unhinged by sim­u­la­tion</em>, all deter­mi­na­tion evap­o­rates, every act is ter­mi­nated at the end of the cycle having ben­e­fited every­one and having been scat­tered in all direc­tions.</p>

<p>Is any given bomb­ing in Italy the work of left­ist extrem­ists, or extreme-right provo­ca­tion, or a cen­trist mise-en-scène to dis­credit all extreme ter­ror­ists and to shore up its own fail­ing power, or again, is it a police-inspired sce­nario and a form of black­mail to public secu­rity? All of this is simul­ta­ne­ously true, and the search for proof, indeed the objec­tiv­ity of the facts does not put an end to this ver­tigo of inter­pre­ta­tion. That is, we are in a logic of sim­u­la­tion, which no longer has any­thing to do with a logic of facts and an order of reason. Sim­u­la­tion is char­ac­ter­ized by a pre­ces­sion of the model, of all the models based on the merest fact—the models come first, their cir­cu­la­tion, orbital like that of the bomb, con­sti­tutes the gen­uine mag­netic field of the event. The facts no longer have a spe­cific tra­jec­tory, they are born at the inter­sec­tion of models, a single fact can be engen­dered by all the models at once. This antic­i­pa­tion, this pre­ces­sion, this short cir­cuit, this con­fu­sion of the fact with its model (no more diver­gence of mean­ing, no more dialec­ti­cal polar­ity, no more neg­a­tive elec­tric­ity, implo­sion of antag­o­nis­tic poles), is what allows each time for all pos­si­ble inter­pre­ta­tions, even the most con­tra­dic­tory—all true, in the sense that their truth is to be exchanged, in the image of the models from which they derive, in a gen­er­al­ized cycle.</p>
<p>The Com­mu­nists attack the Social­ist Party as if they wished to shat­ter the union of the Left. They give cre­dence to the idea that these resis­tances would come from a more rad­i­cal polit­i­cal need. In fact, it is because they no longer want power. But do they not want power at this junc­ture, one unfa­vor­able to the Left in gen­eral, or unfa­vor­able to them within the Union of the Left—or do they no longer want it, by def­i­ni­tion? When Berlinguer declares: “There is no need to be afraid to see the Com­mu­nists take power in Italy,” it simul­ta­ne­ously sig­ni­fies:</p>
<ul>
<li>that there is no need to be afraid, since the Communists, if they come to power, will change nothing of its fundamental capitalist mechanism;</li>
<li>that there is no risk that they will ever come to power (because they don’t want to) and even if they occupy the seat of power, they will never exercise it except by proxy;</li>
<li>that in fact, power, genuine power no longer exists, and thus there is no risk whoever seizes power or seizes it again;</li>
<li>but further: I, Berlinguer, am not afraid to see the Communists take power in Italy which may seem self-evident, but not as much as you might think, because</li>
<li>it could mean the opposite (no need for psychoanalysis here): I am afraid to see the Communists take power (and there are good reasons for that, even for a Communist).</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this is simul­ta­ne­ously true. It is the secret of a dis­course that is no longer simply ambigu­ous, as polit­i­cal dis­courses can be, but that con­veys the impos­si­bil­ity of a deter­mined posi­tion of power, the impos­si­bil­ity of a deter­mined dis­cur­sive posi­tion. And this logic is nei­ther that of one party nor of another. It tra­verses all dis­courses with­out them want­ing it to.</p>
<p>Who will unravel this imbroglio? The Gor­dian knot can at least be cut. The Möbius strip, if one divides it, results in a sup­ple­men­tary spiral with­out the reversibil­ity of sur­faces being resolved (here the reversible con­ti­nu­ity of hypothe­ses). Hell of sim­u­la­tion, which is no longer one of tor­ture, but of the subtle, malef­i­cent, elu­sive twist­ing of mean­ing<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>—where even the con­demned at Burgos are still a gift from Franco to West­ern democ­racy, which seizes the occa­sion to regen­er­ate its own flag­ging human­ism and whose indig­nant protest in turn con­sol­i­dates Franco’s regime by unit­ing the Span­ish masses against this for­eign inter­ven­tion? Where is the truth of all that, when such col­lu­sions admirably knot them­selves together with­out the knowl­edge of their authors?</p>
<p>Con­junc­tion of the system and of its extreme alter­na­tive like the two sides of a curved mirror, a “vicious” cur­va­ture of a polit­i­cal space that is hence­forth mag­ne­tized, cir­cu­lar­ized, reversibi­lized from the right to the left, a tor­sion that is like that of the evil spirit of com­mu­ta­tion, the whole system, the infin­ity of cap­i­tal folded back on its own sur­face: trans­fi­nite? And is it not the same for desire and the libid­i­nal space? Con­junc­tion of desire and value, of desire and cap­i­tal. Con­junc­tion of desire and the law, the final plea­sure as the meta­mor­pho­sis of the law (which is why it is so widely the order of the day): only cap­i­tal takes plea­sure, said Lyotard, before think­ing that we now take plea­sure in cap­i­tal. Over­whelm­ing ver­sa­til­ity of desire in Deleuze, an enig­matic rever­sal that brings desire “rev­o­lu­tion­ary in itself, and as if invol­un­tar­ily, want­ing what it wants,” to desire its own repres­sion and to invest in para­noid and fas­cist sys­tems? A malign tor­sion that returns this rev­o­lu­tion of desire to the same fun­da­men­tal ambi­gu­ity as the other, the his­tor­i­cal rev­o­lu­tion.</p>
<p>All the ref­er­en­tials com­bine their dis­courses in a cir­cu­lar, Möbian com­pul­sion. Not so long ago, sex and work were fiercely opposed terms; today both are dis­solved in the same type of demand. For­merly the dis­course on his­tory derived its power from vio­lently oppos­ing itself to that of nature, the dis­course of desire to that of power—today they exchange their sig­ni­fiers and their sce­nar­ios.</p>
<p>It would take too long to tra­verse the entire range of the oper­a­tional neg­a­tiv­ity of all those sce­nar­ios of deter­rence, which, like Water­gate, try to regen­er­ate a mori­bund prin­ci­ple through sim­u­lated scan­dal, phan­tasm, and murder—a sort of hor­monal treat­ment through neg­a­tiv­ity and crisis. It is always a ques­tion of prov­ing the real through the imag­i­nary, prov­ing truth through scan­dal, prov­ing the law through trans­gres­sion, prov­ing work through strik­ing, prov­ing the system through crisis, and cap­i­tal through rev­o­lu­tion, as it is else­where (the Tasa­day) of prov­ing eth­nol­ogy through the dis­pos­ses­sion of its object—with­out taking into account:</p>
<ul>
<li>the proof of theater through antitheater;</li>
<li>the proof of art through antiart;</li>
<li>the proof of pedagogy through antipedagogy;</li>
<li>the proof of psychiatry through antipsychiatry, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every­thing is meta­mor­phosed into its oppo­site to per­pet­u­ate itself in its expur­gated form. All the powers, all the insti­tu­tions speak of them­selves through denial, in order to attempt, by sim­u­lat­ing death, to escape their real death throes. Power can stage its own murder to redis­cover a glim­mer of exis­tence and legit­i­macy. Such was the case with some Amer­i­can pres­i­dents: the Kennedys were mur­dered because they still had a polit­i­cal dimen­sion. The others, John­son, Nixon, Ford, only had the right to phan­tom attempts, to sim­u­lated mur­ders. But this aura of an arti­fi­cial menace was still nec­es­sary to con­ceal that they were no longer any­thing but the man­nequins of power. For­merly, the king (also the god) had to die, therein lay his power. Today, he is mis­er­ably forced to feign death, in order to pre­serve the <em>bless­ing</em> of power. But it is lost.</p>
<p>To seek new blood in its own death, to renew the cycle through the mirror of crisis, neg­a­tiv­ity, and antipower: this is the only solu­tion-alibi of every power, of every insti­tu­tion attempt­ing to break the vicious circle of its irre­spon­si­bil­ity and of its fun­da­men­tal nonex­is­tence, of its already seen and of its already dead.</p>

<h2>The Strategy of the Real</h2>
<div class="noindent">
<p>The impos­si­bil­ity of redis­cov­er­ing an abso­lute level of the real is of the same order as the impos­si­bil­ity of stag­ing illu­sion. Illu­sion is no longer pos­si­ble, because the real is no longer pos­si­ble. It is the whole <em>polit­i­cal</em> prob­lem of parody, of hyper­sim­u­la­tion or offen­sive sim­u­la­tion, that is posed here.</p>
</div>
<p>For exam­ple: it would be inter­est­ing to see whether the repres­sive appa­ra­tus would not react more vio­lently to a sim­u­lated holdup than to a real holdup. Because the latter does noth­ing but dis­turb the order of things, the right to prop­erty, whereas the former attacks the real­ity prin­ci­ple itself. Trans­gres­sion and vio­lence are less seri­ous because they only con­test the <em>dis­tri­bu­tion</em> of the real. Sim­u­la­tion is infin­itely more dan­ger­ous because it always leaves open to sup­po­si­tion that, above and beyond its object, <em>law and order them­selves might be noth­ing but sim­u­la­tion</em>.</p>
<p>But the dif­fi­culty is pro­por­tional to the danger. How to feign a vio­la­tion and put it to the test? Sim­u­late a rob­bery in a large store: how to per­suade secu­rity that it is a sim­u­lated rob­bery? There is no “objec­tive” dif­fer­ence: the ges­tures, the signs are the same as for a real rob­bery, the signs do not lean to one side or another. To the estab­lished order they are always of the order of the real.</p>
<p>Orga­nize a fake holdup. Verify that your weapons are harm­less, and take the most trust­wor­thy hostage, so that no human life will be in danger (or one lapses into the crim­i­nal). Demand a ransom, and make it so that the oper­a­tion cre­ates as much com­mo­tion as pos­si­ble—in short, remain close to the “truth,” in order to test the reac­tion of the appa­ra­tus to a per­fect sim­u­lacrum. You won’t be able to do it: the net­work of arti­fi­cial signs will become inex­tri­ca­bly mixed up with real ele­ments (a police­man will really fire on sight; a client of the bank will faint and die of a heart attack; one will actu­ally pay you the phony ransom), in short, you will imme­di­ately find your­self once again, with­out wish­ing it, in the real, one of whose func­tions is pre­cisely to devour any attempt at sim­u­la­tion, to reduce every­thing to the real—that is, to the estab­lished order itself, well before insti­tu­tions and jus­tice come into play.</p>
<p>It is nec­es­sary to see in this impos­si­bil­ity of iso­lat­ing the process of sim­u­la­tion the weight of an order that cannot see and con­ceive of any­thing but the real, because it cannot func­tion any­where else. The sim­u­la­tion of an offense, if it is estab­lished as such, will either be pun­ished less severely (because it has no “con­se­quences”) or pun­ished as an offense against the judi­cial system (for exam­ple if one sets in motion a police oper­a­tion “for noth­ing”)—but <em>never as sim­u­la­tion</em> since it is pre­cisely as such that no equiv­a­lence with the real is pos­si­ble, and hence no repres­sion either. The chal­lenge of sim­u­la­tion is never admit­ted by power. How can the sim­u­la­tion of virtue be pun­ished? How­ever, as such it is as seri­ous as the sim­u­la­tion of crime. Parody ren­ders sub­mis­sion and trans­gres­sion equiv­a­lent, and that is the most seri­ous crime, because it <em>can­cels out the dif­fer­ence upon which the law is based</em>. The estab­lished order can do noth­ing against it, because the law is a sim­u­lacrum of the second order, whereas sim­u­la­tion is of the third order, beyond true and false, beyond equiv­a­lences, beyond ratio­nal dis­tinc­tions upon which the whole of the social and power depend. Thus, <em>lack­ing the real</em>, it is there that we must aim at order.</p>
<p>This is cer­tainly why order always opts for the real. When in doubt, it always prefers this hypoth­e­sis (as in the army one prefers to take the sim­u­la­tor for a real madman). But this becomes more and more dif­fi­cult, because if it is prac­ti­cally impos­si­ble to iso­late the process of sim­u­la­tion, through the force of iner­tia of the real that sur­rounds us, the oppo­site is also true (and this reversibil­ity itself is part of the appa­ra­tus of sim­u­la­tion and the impo­tence of power): namely, it is <em>now impos­si­ble to iso­late the process of the real</em>, or to prove the real.</p>
<p>This is how all the holdups, air­plane hijack­ings, etc. are now in some sense sim­u­la­tion holdups in that they are already inscribed in the decod­ing and orches­tra­tion rit­u­als of the media, antic­i­pated in their pre­sen­ta­tion and their pos­si­ble con­se­quences. In short, where they func­tion as a group of signs ded­i­cated exclu­sively to their recur­rence as signs, and no longer at all to their “real” end. But this does not make them harm­less. On the con­trary, it is as hyper­real events, no longer with a spe­cific con­tent or end, but indef­i­nitely refracted by each other (just like so-called his­tor­i­cal events: strikes, demon­stra­tions, crises, etc.),<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> it is in this sense that they cannot be con­trolled by an order that can only exert itself on the real and the ratio­nal, on causes and ends, a ref­er­en­tial order that can only reign over the ref­er­en­tial, a deter­mined power that can only reign over a deter­mined world, but that cannot do any­thing against this indef­i­nite recur­rence of sim­u­la­tion, against this nebula whose weight no longer obeys the laws of grav­i­ta­tion of the real, power itself ends by being dis­man­tled in this space and becom­ing a sim­u­la­tion of power (dis­con­nected from its ends and its objec­tives, and ded­i­cated to the <em>effects of power</em> and mass sim­u­la­tion).</p>
<p>The only weapon of power, its only strat­egy against this defec­tion, is to rein­ject the real and the ref­er­en­tial every­where, to per­suade us of the real­ity of the social, of the grav­ity of the econ­omy and the final­i­ties of pro­duc­tion. To this end it prefers the dis­course of crisis, but also, why not? that of desire. “Take your desires for real­ity!” can be under­stood as the ulti­mate slogan of power since in a non­ref­er­en­tial world, even the con­fu­sion of the real­ity prin­ci­ple and the prin­ci­ple of desire is less dan­ger­ous than con­ta­gious hyper­re­al­ity. One remains among prin­ci­ples, and among those power is always in the right.</p>
<p>Hyper­re­al­ity and sim­u­la­tion are deter­rents of every prin­ci­ple and every objec­tive, they turn against power the deter­rent that it used so well for such a long time. Because in the end, through­out its his­tory it was cap­i­tal that first fed on the destruc­tura­tion of every ref­er­en­tial, of every human objec­tive, that shat­tered every ideal dis­tinc­tion between true and false, good and evil, in order to estab­lish a rad­i­cal law of equiv­a­lence and exchange, the iron law of its power. Cap­i­tal was the first to play at deter­rence, abstrac­tion, dis­con­nec­tion, deter­ri­to­ri­al­iza­tion, etc., and if it is the one that fos­tered real­ity, the real­ity prin­ci­ple, it was also the first to liq­ui­date it by exter­mi­nat­ing all use value, all real equiv­a­lence of pro­duc­tion and wealth, in the very sense we have of the unre­al­ity of the stakes and the omnipo­tence of manip­u­la­tion. Well, today it is this same logic that is even more set against cap­i­tal. And as soon as it wishes to combat this dis­as­trous spiral by secret­ing a last glim­mer of real­ity, on which to estab­lish a last glim­mer of power, it does noth­ing but mul­ti­ply the <em>signs</em> and accel­er­ate the play of sim­u­la­tion.</p>
<p>As long as the his­tor­i­cal threat came at it from the real, power played at deter­rence and sim­u­la­tion, dis­in­te­grat­ing all the con­tra­dic­tions by dint of pro­duc­ing equiv­a­lent signs. Today when the danger comes at it from sim­u­la­tion (that of being dis­solved in the play of signs), power plays at the real, plays at crisis, plays at reman­u­fac­tur­ing arti­fi­cial, social, eco­nomic, and polit­i­cal stakes. For power, it is a ques­tion of life and death. But it is too late.</p>
<p>Whence the char­ac­ter­is­tic hys­te­ria of our times: that of the pro­duc­tion and repro­duc­tion of the real. The other pro­duc­tion, that of values and com­modi­ties, that of the belle epoque of polit­i­cal econ­omy, has for a long time had no spe­cific mean­ing. What every soci­ety looks for in con­tin­u­ing to pro­duce, and to over­pro­duce, is to restore the real that escapes it. That is why <em>today this “mate­rial” pro­duc­tion is that of the hyper­real itself</em>. It retains all the fea­tures, the whole dis­course of tra­di­tional pro­duc­tion, but it is no longer any­thing but its scaled-down refrac­tion (thus hyper­re­al­ists fix a real from which all mean­ing and charm, all depth and energy of rep­re­sen­ta­tion have van­ished in a hal­lu­ci­na­tory resem­blance). Thus every­where the hyper­re­al­ism of sim­u­la­tion is trans­lated by the hal­lu­ci­na­tory resem­blance of the real to itself.</p>
<p>Power itself has for a long time pro­duced noth­ing but the <em>signs</em> of its resem­blance. And at the same time, another figure of power comes into play: that of a col­lec­tive demand for signs of power—a holy union that is recon­structed around its dis­ap­pear­ance. The whole world adheres to it more or less in terror of the col­lapse of the polit­i­cal. And in the end the game of power becomes noth­ing but the <em>crit­i­cal</em> obses­sion with power—obses­sion with its death, obses­sion with its sur­vival, which increases as it dis­ap­pears. When it has totally dis­ap­peared, we will log­i­cally be under the total hal­lu­ci­na­tion of power—a haunt­ing memory that is already in evi­dence every­where, express­ing at once the com­pul­sion to get rid of it (no one wants it any­more, every­one unloads it on every­one else) and the pan­icked nos­tal­gia over its loss. The melan­choly of soci­eties with­out power: this has already stirred up fas­cism, that over­dose of a strong ref­er­en­tial in a soci­ety that cannot ter­mi­nate its mourn­ing.</p>
<p>With the exten­u­a­tion of the polit­i­cal sphere, the pres­i­dent comes increas­ingly to resem­ble that <em>Puppet of Power</em> who is the head of prim­i­tive soci­eties (Clas­tres).</p>
<p>All pre­vi­ous pres­i­dents pay for and con­tinue to pay for Kennedy’s murder as if they were the ones who had sup­pressed it—which is true phan­tas­mat­i­cally, if not in fact. They must efface this defect and this com­plic­ity with their sim­u­lated murder. Because, now it can only be sim­u­lated. Pres­i­dents John­son and Ford were both the object of failed assas­si­na­tion attempts which, if they were not staged, were at least per­pe­trated by sim­u­la­tion. The Kennedys died because they incar­nated some­thing: the polit­i­cal, polit­i­cal sub­stance, whereas the new pres­i­dents are noth­ing but car­i­ca­tures and fake film—curi­ously, John­son, Nixon, Ford, all have this simian mug, the mon­keys of power.</p>
<p>Death is never an abso­lute cri­te­rion, but in this case it is sig­nif­i­cant: the era of James Dean, Mar­i­lyn Monroe, and the Kennedys, of those who really died simply because they had a mythic dimen­sion that implies death (not for roman­tic rea­sons, but because of the fun­da­men­tal prin­ci­ple of rever­sal and exchange)—this era is long gone. It is now the era of murder by sim­u­la­tion, of the gen­er­al­ized aes­thetic of sim­u­la­tion, of the murder-alibi the alle­gor­i­cal res­ur­rec­tion of death, which is only there to sanc­tion the insti­tu­tion of power, with­out which it no longer has any sub­stance or an auton­o­mous real­ity.</p>
<p>These staged pres­i­den­tial assas­si­na­tions are reveal­ing because they signal the status of all neg­a­tiv­ity in the West: polit­i­cal oppo­si­tion, the “Left,” crit­i­cal dis­course, etc.—a sim­u­lacral con­trast through which power attempts to break the vicious circle of its nonex­is­tence, of its fun­da­men­tal irre­spon­si­bil­ity, of its “sus­pen­sion.” Power floats like money, like lan­guage, like theory. Crit­i­cism and neg­a­tiv­ity alone still secrete a phan­tom of the real­ity of power. If they become weak for one reason or another, power has no other recourse but to arti­fi­cially revive and hal­lu­ci­nate them.</p>
<p>It is in this way that the Span­ish exe­cu­tions still serve as a stim­u­lant to West­ern lib­eral democ­racy, to a dying system of demo­cratic values. Fresh blood, but for how much longer? The dete­ri­o­ra­tion of all power is irre­sistibly pur­sued: it is not so much the “rev­o­lu­tion­ary forces” that accel­er­ate this process (often it is quite the oppo­site), it is the system itself that deploys against its own struc­tures this vio­lence that annuls all sub­stance and all final­ity. One must not resist this process by trying to con­front the system and destroy it, because this system that is dying from being dis­pos­sessed of its death expects noth­ing but that from us: that we give the system back its death, that we revive it through the neg­a­tive. End of rev­o­lu­tion­ary praxis, end of the dia­lec­tic. Curi­ously, Nixon, who was not even found worthy of dying at the hands of the most insignif­i­cant, chance, unbal­anced person (and though it is per­haps true that pres­i­dents are assas­si­nated by unbal­anced types, this changes <em>noth­ing</em>: the left­ist pen­chant for detect­ing a right­ist con­spir­acy beneath this brings out a false prob­lem—the func­tion of bring­ing death to, or the prophecy, etc., against power has always been ful­filled, from prim­i­tive soci­eties to the present, by demented people, crazy people, or neu­rotics, who none­the­less carry out a social func­tion as fun­da­men­tal as that of pres­i­dents), was nev­er­the­less rit­u­ally put to death by Water­gate. Water­gate is still a mech­a­nism for the ritual murder of power (the Amer­i­can insti­tu­tion of the pres­i­dency is much more thrilling in this regard than the Euro­pean: it sur­rounds itself with all the vio­lence and vicis­si­tudes of prim­i­tive powers, of savage rit­u­als). But already impeach­ment is no longer assas­si­na­tion: it hap­pens via the Con­sti­tu­tion. Nixon has nev­er­the­less arrived at the goal of which all power dreams: to be taken seri­ously enough, to con­sti­tute a mortal enough danger to the group to be one day relieved of his duties, denounced, and liq­ui­dated. Ford doesn’t even have this oppor­tu­nity any­more: a sim­u­lacrum of an already dead power, he can only accu­mu­late against him­self the signs of rever­sion through murder—in fact, he is immu­nized by his impo­tence, which infu­ri­ates him.</p>
<p>In con­trast to the prim­i­tive rite, which fore­sees the offi­cial and sac­ri­fi­cial death of the king (the king or the chief is noth­ing with­out the prom­ise of his sac­ri­fice), the modern polit­i­cal imag­i­nary goes increas­ingly in the direc­tion of delay­ing, of con­ceal­ing for as long as pos­si­ble, the death of the head of state. This obses­sion has accu­mu­lated since the era of rev­o­lu­tions and of charis­matic lead­ers: Hitler, Franco, Mao, having no “legit­i­mate” heirs, no fil­i­a­tion of power, see them­selves forced to per­pet­u­ate them­selves indef­i­nitely—pop­u­lar myth never wishes to believe them dead. The pharaohs already did this: it was always one and the same person who incar­nated the suc­ces­sive pharaohs.</p>
<p>Every­thing hap­pens as if Mao or Franco had already died sev­eral times and had been replaced by his double. From a polit­i­cal point of view, that a head of state remains the same or is some­one else doesn’t strictly change any­thing, so long as they resem­ble each other. For a long time now a head of state—<em>no matter which one</em>—is noth­ing but the sim­u­lacrum of him­self, and <em>only that gives him the power and the qual­ity to govern</em>. No one would grant the least con­sent, the least devo­tion to a real person. It is to his double, he being always already <em>dead</em>, to which alle­giance is given. This myth does noth­ing but trans­late the per­sis­tence, and at the same time the decep­tion, of the neces­sity of the king’s sac­ri­fi­cial death.</p>
<p>We are still in the same boat: no soci­ety knows how to mourn the real, power, the <em>social itself</em>, which is impli­cated in the same loss. And it is through an arti­fi­cial revi­tal­iza­tion of all this that we try to escape this fact. <em>This sit­u­a­tion will no doubt end up giving rise to social­ism</em>. Through an unfore­seen turn of events and via an irony that is no longer that of his­tory, it is from the death of the social that social­ism will emerge, as it is from the death of God that reli­gions emerge. A twisted advent, a per­verse event, an unin­tel­li­gi­ble rever­sion to the logic of reason. As is the fact that power is in essence no longer present except to con­ceal that there is no more power. A sim­u­la­tion that can last indef­i­nitely, because, as dis­tinct from “true” power—which is, or was, a struc­ture, a strat­egy, a rela­tion of force, a stake—it is noth­ing but the object of a social <em>demand</em>, and thus as the object of the law of supply and demand, it is no longer sub­ject to vio­lence and death. Com­pletely purged of a <em>polit­i­cal</em> dimen­sion, it, like any other com­mod­ity, is depen­dent on mass pro­duc­tion and con­sump­tion. Its spark has dis­ap­peared, only the fic­tion of a polit­i­cal uni­verse remains.</p>
<p>The same holds true for work. The spark of pro­duc­tion, the vio­lence of its stakes no longer exist. The whole world still pro­duces, and increas­ingly, but subtly work has become some­thing else: a need (as Marx ide­ally envi­sioned it but not in the same sense), the object of a social “demand,” like leisure, to which it is equiv­a­lent in the course of every­day life. A demand exactly pro­por­tional to the loss of a stake in the work process.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Same change in for­tune as for power: the <em>sce­nario</em> of work is there to con­ceal that the real of work, the real of pro­duc­tion, has dis­ap­peared. And the real of the strike as well, which is no longer a work stop­page, but its alter­nate pole in the ritual scan­sion of the social cal­en­dar. Every­thing occurs as if each person had, after declar­ing a strike, “occu­pied” his place and work sta­tion and recom­menced pro­duc­tion, as is the norm in a “self-man­aged” occu­pa­tion, exactly in the same terms as before, all while declar­ing him­self (and in vir­tu­ally being) per­ma­nently on strike.</p>
<p>This is not a dream out of sci­ence fic­tion: every­where it is a ques­tion of dou­bling the process of work. And of a dou­bling of the process of going on strike—strik­ing incor­po­rated just as obso­les­cence is in objects, just as crisis is in pro­duc­tion. So, there is no longer strik­ing, nor work, but both simul­ta­ne­ously, that is to say some­thing else: a <em>magic of work</em>, a trompe l’oeil, a scen­odrama (so as not to say a melo­drama) of pro­duc­tion, a col­lec­tive dra­maturgy on the empty stage of the social.</p>
<p>It is no longer a ques­tion of the ide­ol­ogy of work—the tra­di­tional ethic that would obscure the “real” process of work and the “objec­tive” process of exploita­tion—but of the sce­nario of work. In the same way, it is no longer a ques­tion of the ide­ol­ogy of power, but of the <em>sce­nario</em> of power. Ide­ol­ogy only cor­re­sponds to a cor­rup­tion of real­ity through signs; sim­u­la­tion cor­re­sponds to a short cir­cuit of real­ity and to its dupli­ca­tion through signs. It is always the goal of the ide­o­log­i­cal anal­y­sis to restore the objec­tive process, it is always a false prob­lem to wish to restore the truth beneath the sim­u­lacrum.</p>
<p>This is why in the end power is so much in tune with ide­o­log­i­cal dis­courses and dis­courses on ide­ol­ogy, that is they are dis­courses of <em>truth</em>—always good for coun­ter­ing the mortal blows of sim­u­la­tion, even and espe­cially if they are rev­o­lu­tion­ary.</p>

<h2>The End of the Panopticon</h2>
<div class="noindent">
<p>It is still to this ide­ol­ogy of lived expe­ri­ence—exhuma­tion of the real in its fun­da­men­tal banal­ity, in its rad­i­cal authen­tic­ity—that the Amer­i­can TV verité exper­i­ment attempted on the Loud family in 1971 refers: seven months of unin­ter­rupted shoot­ing, three hun­dred hours of non­stop broad­cast­ing, with­out a script or a screen­play, the odyssey of a family, its dramas, its joys, its unex­pected events, non­stop—in short, a “raw” his­tor­i­cal doc­u­ment, and the “great­est tele­vi­sion per­for­mance, com­pa­ra­ble, on the scale of our day-to-day life, to the footage of our land­ing on the moon.” It becomes more com­pli­cated because this family fell apart during the film­ing: a crisis erupted, the Louds sep­a­rated, etc. Whence that insol­u­ble con­tro­versy: was TV itself respon­si­ble? What would have hap­pened if TV <em>hadn’t been there?</em></p>
</div>
<p>More inter­est­ing is the illu­sion of film­ing the Louds <em>as if TV weren’t there</em>. The pro­ducer’s tri­umph was to say: “They lived as if we were not there.” An absurd, para­dox­i­cal for­mula—nei­ther true nor false: utopian. The “as if we were not there” being equal to “as if you were there.” It is this utopia, this para­dox that fas­ci­nated the twenty mil­lion view­ers, much more than did the “per­verse” plea­sure of vio­lat­ing some­one’s pri­vacy. In the “verité” expe­ri­ence it is not a ques­tion of secrecy or per­ver­sion, but of a sort of fris­son of the real, or of an aes­thet­ics of the hyper­real, a fris­son of ver­tig­i­nous and phony exac­ti­tude, a fris­son of simul­ta­ne­ous dis­tanc­ing and mag­ni­fi­ca­tion, of dis­tor­tion of scale, of an exces­sive trans­parency. The plea­sure of an excess of mean­ing, when the bar of the sign falls below the usual water­line of mean­ing: the non­signi­fier is exalted by the camera angle. There one sees what the real never was (but “as if you were there”), with­out the dis­tance that gives us per­spec­ti­val space and depth vision (but “more real than nature”). Plea­sure in the micro­scopic sim­u­la­tion that allows the real to pass into the hyper­real. (This is also some­what the case in porno, which is fas­ci­nat­ing more on a meta­phys­i­cal than on a sexual level.)</p>
<p>Besides, this family was already hyper­real by the very nature of its selec­tion: a typ­i­cal ideal Amer­i­can family, Cal­i­for­nia home, three garages, five chil­dren, assured social and pro­fes­sional status, dec­o­ra­tive house­wife, upper-middle-class stand­ing. In a way it is this sta­tis­ti­cal per­fec­tion that dooms it to death. Ideal hero­ine of the Amer­i­can way of life, it is, as in ancient sac­ri­fices, chosen in order to be glo­ri­fied and to die beneath the flames of the medium, a modern <em>fatum</em>. Because heav­enly fire no longer falls on cor­rupted cities, it is the camera lens that, like a laser, comes to pierce lived real­ity in order to put it to death. “The Louds: simply a family who agreed to deliver them­selves into the hands of tele­vi­sion, and to die by it,” the direc­tor will say. Thus it is a ques­tion of a sac­ri­fi­cial process, of a sac­ri­fi­cial spec­ta­cle offered to twenty mil­lion Amer­i­cans. The litur­gi­cal drama of a mass soci­ety.</p>
<p>TV verité. A term admirable in its ambi­gu­ity, does it refer to the truth of this family or to the truth of TV? In fact, it is TV that is the truth of the Louds, it is TV that is true, it is TV that ren­ders true. Truth that is no longer the reflex­ive truth of the mirror, nor the per­spec­ti­val truth of the panop­tic system and of the gaze, but the manip­u­la­tive truth of the test that sounds out and inter­ro­gates, of the laser that touches and pierces, of com­puter cards that retain your pre­ferred sequences, of the genetic code that con­trols your com­bi­na­tions, of cells that inform your sen­sory uni­verse. It is to this truth that the Loud family was sub­jected by the medium of TV, and in this sense it amounts to a death sen­tence (but is it still a ques­tion of truth?).</p>
<p><em>End of the panop­tic system</em>. The eye of TV is no longer the source of an abso­lute gaze, and the ideal of con­trol is no longer that of trans­parency. This still pre­sup­poses an objec­tive space (that of the Renais­sance) and the omnipo­tence of the despotic gaze. It is still, if not a system of con­fine­ment, at least a system of map­ping. More subtly, but always exter­nally, play­ing on the oppo­si­tion of seeing and being seen, even if the panop­tic focal point may be blind.</p>
<p>Some­thing else in regard to the Louds. “You no longer watch TV, it is TV that watches you (live),” or again: “You are no longer lis­ten­ing to Don’t Panic, it is Don’t Panic that is lis­ten­ing to you”—a switch from the panop­tic mech­a­nism of sur­veil­lance (<em>Dis­ci­pline and Punish</em> [Surveiller et punir]) to a system of deter­rence, in which the dis­tinc­tion between the pas­sive and the active is abol­ished. There is no longer any imper­a­tive of sub­mis­sion to the model, or to the gaze “<span class="smallcaps">you</span> are the model!” “<span class="smallcaps">you</span> are the major­ity!” Such is the water­shed of a hyper­real social­ity, in which the real is con­fused with the model, as in the sta­tis­ti­cal oper­a­tion, or with the medium, as in the Louds’ oper­a­tion. Such is the last stage of the social rela­tion, ours, which is no longer one of per­sua­sion (the clas­si­cal age of pro­pa­ganda, of ide­ol­ogy, of pub­lic­ity, etc.) but one of deter­rence: “<span class="smallcaps">you</span> are infor­ma­tion, you are the social, you are the event, you are involved, you have the word, etc.” An about-face through which it becomes impos­si­ble to locate one instance of the model, of power, of the gaze, of the medium itself, because you are always already on the other side. No more sub­ject, no more focal point, no more center or periph­ery: pure flex­ion or cir­cu­lar inflex­ion. No more vio­lence or sur­veil­lance: only “infor­ma­tion,” secret vir­u­lence, chain reac­tion, slow implo­sion, and sim­u­lacra of spaces in which the effect of the real again comes into play.</p>
<p>We are wit­ness­ing the end of per­spec­ti­val and panop­tic space (which remains a moral hypoth­e­sis bound up with all the clas­si­cal analy­ses on the “objec­tive” essence of power), and thus to the <em>very abo­li­tion of the spec­tac­u­lar</em>. Tele­vi­sion, for exam­ple in the case of the Louds, is no longer a spec­tac­u­lar medium. We are no longer in the soci­ety of the spec­ta­cle, of which the sit­u­a­tion­ists spoke, nor in the spe­cific kinds of alien­ation and repres­sion that it implied. The medium itself is no longer iden­ti­fi­able as such, and the con­fu­sion of the medium and the mes­sage (McLuhan)<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> is the first great for­mula of this new era. There is no longer a medium in the lit­eral sense: it is now intan­gi­ble, dif­fused, and diffracted in the real, and one can no longer even say that the medium is altered by it.</p>
<p>Such a blend­ing, such a viral, endemic, chronic, alarm­ing pres­ence of the medium, with­out the pos­si­bil­ity of iso­lat­ing the effects—spec­tral­ized, like these adver­tis­ing laser sculp­tures in the empty space of the event fil­tered by the medium—dis­so­lu­tion of TV in life, dis­so­lu­tion of life in TV—indis­cernible chem­i­cal solu­tion: we are all Louds doomed not to inva­sion, to pres­sure, to vio­lence and black­mail by the media and the models, but to their induc­tion, to their infil­tra­tion, to their illeg­i­ble vio­lence.</p>
<p>But one must watch out for the neg­a­tive turn that dis­course imposes: it is a ques­tion nei­ther of dis­ease nor of a viral infec­tion. One must think instead of the media as if they were, in outer orbit, a kind of genetic code that directs the muta­tion of the real into the hyper­real, just as the other micro­molec­u­lar code con­trols the pas­sage from a rep­re­sen­ta­tive sphere of mean­ing to the genetic one of the pro­grammed signal.</p>
<p>It is the whole tra­di­tional world of causal­ity that is in ques­tion: the per­spec­ti­val, deter­min­ist mode, the “active,” crit­i­cal mode, the ana­lytic mode—the dis­tinc­tion between cause and effect, between active and pas­sive, between sub­ject and object, between the end and the means. It is in this sense that one can say: TV is watch­ing us, TV alien­ates us, TV manip­u­lates us, TV informs us … In all this, one remains depen­dent on the ana­lyt­i­cal con­cep­tion of the media, on an exter­nal active and effec­tive agent, on “per­spec­ti­val” infor­ma­tion with the hori­zon of the real and of mean­ing as the van­ish­ing point.</p>
<p>Now, one must con­ceive of TV along the lines of DNA as an effect in which the oppos­ing poles of deter­mi­na­tion vanish, accord­ing to a nuclear con­trac­tion, retrac­tion, of the old polar schema that always main­tained a min­i­mal dis­tance between cause and effect, between sub­ject and object: pre­cisely the dis­tance of mean­ing, the gap, the dif­fer­ence, the small­est pos­si­ble gap (PPEP!),<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> irre­duc­ible under pain of reab­sorp­tion into an aleatory and inde­ter­mi­nate process whose dis­course can no longer account for it, because it is itself a deter­mined order.</p>
<p>It is this gap that van­ishes in the process of genetic coding, in which inde­ter­mi­nacy is not so much a ques­tion of molec­u­lar ran­dom­ness as of the abo­li­tion, pure and simple, of the rela­tion. In the process of molec­u­lar con­trol, which “goes” from the DNA nucleus to the “sub­stance” that it “informs,” there is no longer the tra­ver­sal of an effect, of an energy, of a deter­mi­na­tion, of a mes­sage. “Order, signal, impulse, mes­sage”: all of these attempt to render the thing intel­li­gi­ble to us, but by anal­ogy, retran­scrib­ing in terms of inscrip­tion, of a vector, of decod­ing, a dimen­sion of which we know noth­ing—it is no longer even a “dimen­sion,” or per­haps it is the fourth (which is defined, how­ever, in Ein­steinian rel­a­tiv­ity by the absorp­tion of the dis­tinct poles of space and time). In fact, this whole process can only be under­stood in its neg­a­tive form: noth­ing sep­a­rates one pole from another any­more, the begin­ning from the end; there is a kind of con­trac­tion of one over the other, a fan­tas­tic tele­scop­ing, a col­lapse of the two tra­di­tional poles into each other: <em>implo­sion</em>—an absorp­tion of the radi­at­ing mode of causal­ity, of the dif­fer­en­tial mode of deter­mi­na­tion, with its pos­i­tive and neg­a­tive charge—an implo­sion of mean­ing. <em>That is where sim­u­la­tion begins</em>.</p>
<p>Every­where, in no matter what domain—polit­i­cal, bio­log­i­cal, psy­cho­log­i­cal, medi­a­tized in which the dis­tinc­tion between these two poles can no longer be main­tained, one enters into sim­u­la­tion, and thus into abso­lute manip­u­la­tion—not into pas­siv­ity, but into <em>the dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion of the active and the pas­sive</em>. DNA real­izes this aleatory reduc­tion at the level of living matter. Tele­vi­sion, in the case of the Louds, also reaches this indef­i­nite limit in which, vis-à-vis TV, they are nei­ther more nor less active or pas­sive than a living sub­stance is vis-à-vis its molec­u­lar code. Here and there, a single nebula whose simple ele­ments are inde­ci­pher­able, whose truth is inde­ci­pher­able.</p>

<h2>The Orbital and the Nuclear</h2>
<div class="noindent">
<p>The apoth­e­o­sis of sim­u­la­tion: the nuclear. How­ever, the bal­ance of terror is never any­thing but the spec­tac­u­lar slope of a system of deter­rence that has insin­u­ated itself from the <em>inside</em> into all the cracks of daily life. Nuclear sus­pen­sion only serves to seal the triv­i­al­ized system of deter­rence that is at the heart of the media, of the vio­lence with­out con­se­quences that reigns through­out the world, of the aleatory appa­ra­tus of all the choices that are made for us. The most insignif­i­cant of our behav­iors is reg­u­lated by neu­tral­ized, indif­fer­ent, equiv­a­lent signs, by zero-sum signs like those that reg­u­late the “strat­egy of games” (but the true equa­tion is else­where, and the unknown is pre­cisely that vari­able of sim­u­la­tion which makes of the atomic arse­nal itself a hyper­real form, a sim­u­lacrum that dom­i­nates every­thing and reduces all “ground-level” events to being noth­ing but ephemeral sce­nar­ios, trans­form­ing the life left us into sur­vival, into a stake with­out stakes—not even into a life insur­ance policy: into a policy that already has no value).</p>
</div>
<p>It is not the direct threat of atomic destruc­tion that par­a­lyzes our lives, it is deter­rence that gives them leukemia. And this deter­rence comes from that fact that <em>even the real atomic clash is pre­cluded</em>—pre­cluded like the even­tu­al­ity of the real in a system of signs. The whole world pre­tends to believe in the real­ity of this threat (this is under­stand­able on the part of the mil­i­tary, the grav­ity of their exer­cise and the dis­course of their “strat­egy” are at stake), but it is pre­cisely at this level that there are no strate­gic stakes. The whole orig­i­nal­ity of the sit­u­a­tion lies in the improb­a­bil­ity of destruc­tion.</p>
<p>Deter­rence pre­cludes war—the archaic vio­lence of expand­ing sys­tems. Deter­rence itself is the neu­tral, implo­sive vio­lence of metastable sys­tems or sys­tems in invo­lu­tion. There is no longer a sub­ject of deter­rence, nor an adver­sary nor a strat­egy—it is a plan­e­tary struc­ture of the anni­hi­la­tion of stakes. Atomic war, like the Trojan War, will not take place. The risk of nuclear anni­hi­la­tion only serves as a pre­text, through the sophis­ti­ca­tion of weapons (a sophis­ti­ca­tion that sur­passes any pos­si­ble objec­tive to such an extent that it is itself a symp­tom of nul­lity), for installing a uni­ver­sal secu­rity system, a uni­ver­sal lockup and con­trol system whose deter­rent effect is not at all aimed at an atomic clash (which was never in ques­tion, except with­out a doubt in the very ini­tial stages of the cold war, when one still con­fused the nuclear appa­ra­tus with con­ven­tional war) but, rather, at the much greater prob­a­bil­ity of any real event, of any­thing that would be an event in the gen­eral system and upset its bal­ance. The bal­ance of terror is the terror of bal­ance.</p>
<p>Deter­rence is not a strat­egy, it cir­cu­lates and is exchanged between nuclear pro­tag­o­nists exactly as is inter­na­tional cap­i­tal in the orbital zone of mon­e­tary spec­u­la­tion whose fluc­tu­a­tions suf­fice to con­trol all global exchanges. Thus the <em>money of destruc­tion</em> (with­out any ref­er­ence to real destruc­tion, any more than float­ing cap­i­tal has a real ref­er­ent of pro­duc­tion) that cir­cu­lates in nuclear orbit suf­fices to con­trol all the vio­lence and poten­tial con­flicts around the world.</p>
<p>What is hatched in the shadow of this mech­a­nism with the pre­text of a max­i­mal, “objec­tive,” threat, and thanks to Damo­cles’ nuclear sword, is the per­fec­tion of the best system of con­trol that has ever existed. And the pro­gres­sive satel­liza­tion of the whole planet through this hyper­model of secu­rity.</p>
<p>The same goes for <em>peace­ful</em> nuclear power sta­tions. Paci­fi­ca­tion does not dis­tin­guish between the civil and the mil­i­tary: every­where where irre­versible appa­ra­tuses of con­trol are elab­o­rated, every­where where the notion of secu­rity becomes omnipo­tent, every­where where the <em>norm</em> replaces the old arse­nal of laws and vio­lence (includ­ing war), it is the system of deter­rence that grows, and around it grows the his­tor­i­cal, social, and polit­i­cal desert. A gigan­tic invo­lu­tion that makes every con­flict, every final­ity, every con­fronta­tion con­tract in pro­por­tion to this black­mail that inter­rupts, neu­tral­izes, freezes them all. No longer can any revolt, any story be deployed accord­ing to its own logic because it risks anni­hi­la­tion. No strat­egy is pos­si­ble any longer, and esca­la­tion is only a puerile game given over to the mil­i­tary. The polit­i­cal stake is dead, only sim­u­lacra of con­flicts and care­fully cir­cum­scribed stakes remain.</p>
<p>The “space race” played exactly the same role as nuclear esca­la­tion. This is why the space pro­gram was so easily able to replace it in the 1960s (Kennedy/Khrushchev), or to develop con­cur­rently as a form of “peace­ful coex­is­tence.” Because what, ulti­mately, is the func­tion of the space pro­gram, of the con­quest of the moon, of the launch­ing of satel­lites if not the insti­tu­tion of a model of uni­ver­sal grav­i­ta­tion, of satel­liza­tion of which the lunar module is the per­fect embryo? Pro­grammed micro­cosm, where <em>noth­ing can be left to chance</em>. Tra­jec­tory, energy, cal­cu­la­tion, phys­i­ol­ogy, psy­chol­ogy, envi­ron­ment—noth­ing can be left to con­tin­gen­cies, this is the total uni­verse of the norm—the Law no longer exists, it is the oper­a­tional imma­nence of every detail that is law. A uni­verse purged of all threat of mean­ing, in a state of asep­sis and weight­less­ness—it is this very per­fec­tion that is fas­ci­nat­ing. The exal­ta­tion of the crowds was not a response to the event of land­ing on the moon or of send­ing a man into space (this would be, rather, the ful­fill­ment of an ear­lier dream), rather, we are dumb­founded by the per­fec­tion of the pro­gram­ming and the tech­ni­cal manip­u­la­tion, by the imma­nent wonder of the pro­grammed unfold­ing of events. Fas­ci­na­tion with the max­i­mal norm and the mas­tery of prob­a­bil­ity. Ver­tigo of the model, which unites with the model of death, but with­out fear or drive. Because if the law, with its aura of trans­gres­sion, if order, with its aura of vio­lence, still taps a per­verse imag­i­nary, the norm fixes, fas­ci­nates, stu­pe­fies, and makes every imag­i­nary invo­lute. One no longer fan­ta­sizes about the minu­tiae of a pro­gram. Just watch­ing it pro­duces ver­tigo. The ver­tigo of a world with­out flaws.</p>
<p>Now, it is the same model of pro­gram­matic infal­li­bil­ity, of max­i­mum secu­rity and deter­rence that today con­trols the spread of the social. There lies the true nuclear fall­out: the metic­u­lous oper­a­tion of tech­nol­ogy serves as a model for the metic­u­lous oper­a­tion of the social. Here as well, <em>noth­ing will be left to chance</em>, more­over this is the essence of social­iza­tion, which began cen­turies ago, but which has now entered its accel­er­ated phase, toward a limit that one believed would be explo­sive (rev­o­lu­tion), but which for the moment is trans­lated by an inverse, <em>implo­sive</em>, irre­versible process: the gen­er­al­ized deter­rence of chance, of acci­dent, of transver­sal­ity, of final­ity, of con­tra­dic­tion, rup­ture, or com­plex­ity in a social­ity illu­mi­nated by the norm, doomed to the descrip­tive trans­parency of mech­a­nisms of infor­ma­tion. In fact, the spa­tial and nuclear models do not have their own ends: nei­ther the dis­cov­ery of the moon, nor mil­i­tary and strate­gic supe­ri­or­ity. Their truth is to be the models of sim­u­la­tion, the model vec­tors of a system of plan­e­tary con­trol (where even the super­pow­ers of this sce­nario are not free—the whole world is satel­lized).<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Resist the evi­dence: in satel­liza­tion, he who is satel­lized is not who one might think. Through the orbital inscrip­tion of a spa­tial object, it is the planet earth that becomes a satel­lite, it is the ter­res­trial prin­ci­ple of real­ity that becomes eccen­tric, hyper­real, and insignif­i­cant. Through the orbital instan­ti­a­tion of a system of con­trol like peace­ful coex­is­tence, all the ter­res­trial microsys­tems are satel­lized and lose their auton­omy. All energy, all events are absorbed by this eccen­tric grav­i­ta­tion, every­thing con­denses and implodes toward the only micro­model of con­trol (the orbital satel­lite), as con­versely, in the other, bio­log­i­cal, dimen­sion, every­thing con­verges and implodes on the molec­u­lar micro­model of the genetic code. Between the two, in this fork­ing of the nuclear and the genetic, in the simul­ta­ne­ous assump­tion of the two fun­da­men­tal codes of deter­rence, every prin­ci­ple of mean­ing is absorbed, every deploy­ment of the real is impos­si­ble.</p>
<p>The simul­tane­ity of two events in the month of July 1975 illus­trated this in a strik­ing manner: the linkup in space of the two Amer­i­can and Soviet super­satel­lites, apoth­e­o­sis of peace­ful coex­is­tence—the sup­pres­sion by the Chi­nese of ideogram­matic writ­ing and con­ver­sion to the Roman alpha­bet. The latter sig­ni­fies the “orbital” instan­ti­a­tion of an abstract and mod­elized system of signs, into whose orbit all the once unique forms of style and writ­ing will be reab­sorbed. The satel­liza­tion of lan­guage: the means for the Chi­nese to enter the system of peace­ful coex­is­tence, which is inscribed in their heav­ens at pre­cisely the same time by the linkup of the two satel­lites. Orbital flight of the Big Two, neu­tral­iza­tion and homog­e­niza­tion of every­one else on earth.</p>
<p>Yet, despite this deter­rence by the orbital power—the nuclear or molec­u­lar code—events con­tinue at ground level, mis­for­tunes are even more numer­ous, given the global process of the con­ti­gu­ity and simul­tane­ity of data. But, subtly, they no longer have any mean­ing, they are no longer any­thing but the duplex effect of sim­u­la­tion at the summit. The best exam­ple can only be that of the war in Viet­nam, because it took place at the inter­sec­tion of a max­i­mum his­tor­i­cal and “rev­o­lu­tion­ary” stake, and of the instal­la­tion of this deter­rent author­ity. What mean­ing did this war have, and wasn’t its unfold­ing a means of seal­ing the end of his­tory in the deci­sive and cul­mi­nat­ing his­toric event of our era?</p>
<p>Why did this war, so hard, so long, so fero­cious, vanish from one day to the next as if by magic?</p>
<p>Why did this Amer­i­can defeat (the largest rever­sal in the his­tory of the USA) have no inter­nal reper­cus­sions in Amer­ica? If it had really sig­ni­fied the fail­ure of the plan­e­tary strat­egy of the United States, it would nec­es­sar­ily have com­pletely dis­rupted its inter­nal bal­ance and the Amer­i­can polit­i­cal system. Noth­ing of the sort occurred.</p>
<p>Some­thing else, then, took place. This war, at bottom, was noth­ing but a cru­cial episode of peace­ful coex­is­tence. It marked the arrival of China to peace­ful coex­is­tence. The non­in­ter­ven­tion of China obtained and secured after many years, China’s appren­tice­ship to a global modus vivendi, the shift from a global strat­egy of rev­o­lu­tion to one of shared forces and empires, the tran­si­tion from a rad­i­cal alter­na­tive to polit­i­cal alter­na­tion in a system now essen­tially reg­u­lated (the nor­mal­iza­tion of Peking—Wash­ing­ton rela­tions): this was what was at stake in the war in Viet­nam, and in this sense, the USA pulled out of Viet­nam but won the war.</p>
<p>And the war ended “spon­ta­neously” when this objec­tive was achieved. That is why it was deesca­lated, demo­bi­lized so easily.</p>
<p>This same reduc­tion of forces can be seen on the field. The war lasted as long as ele­ments irre­duc­ible to a healthy pol­i­tics and dis­ci­pline of power, even a Com­mu­nist one, remained unliq­ui­dated. When at last the war had passed into the hands of reg­u­lar troops in the North and escaped that of the resis­tance, the war could stop: it had attained its objec­tive. The stake is thus that of a polit­i­cal relay. As soon as the Viet­namese had proved that they were no longer the car­ri­ers of an unpre­dictable sub­ver­sion, one could let them take over. That theirs is a Com­mu­nist order is not seri­ous in the end: it had proved itself, it could be trusted. It is even more effec­tive than cap­i­tal­ism in the liq­ui­da­tion of “savage” and archaic pre­cap­i­tal­ist struc­tures.</p>
<p>Same sce­nario in the Alge­rian war.</p>
<p>The other aspect of this war and of all wars today: behind the armed vio­lence, the mur­der­ous antag­o­nism of the adver­saries—which seems a matter of life and death, which is played out as such (or else one could never send people to get them­selves killed in this kind of thing), behind this sim­u­lacrum of fight­ing to the death and of ruth­less global stakes, the two adver­saries are fun­da­men­tally in sol­i­dar­ity against some­thing else, unnamed, never spoken, but whose objec­tive out­come in war, with the equal com­plic­ity of the two adver­saries, is total liq­ui­da­tion. Tribal, com­mu­ni­tar­ian, pre­cap­i­tal­ist struc­tures, every form of exchange, of lan­guage, of sym­bolic orga­ni­za­tion, that is what must be abol­ished, that is the object of murder in war—and war itself, in its immense, spec­tac­u­lar death appa­ra­tus, is noth­ing but the medium of this process of the ter­ror­ist ratio­nal­iza­tion of the social—the murder on which social­ity will be founded, what­ever its alle­giance, Com­mu­nist or cap­i­tal­ist. Total com­plic­ity, or divi­sion of labor between two adver­saries (who may even con­sent to enor­mous sac­ri­fices for it) for the very end of reshap­ing and domes­ti­cat­ing social rela­tions.</p>
<p>“The North Viet­namese were advised to coun­te­nance a sce­nario for liq­ui­dat­ing the Amer­i­can pres­ence in the course of which, of course, one must save face.”</p>
<p>This sce­nario: the extremely harsh bom­bard­ments of Hanoi. Their unten­able char­ac­ter must not con­ceal the fact that they were noth­ing but a sim­u­lacrum to enable the Viet­namese to seem to coun­te­nance a com­pro­mise and for Nixon to make the Amer­i­cans swal­low the with­drawal of their troops. The game was already won, noth­ing was objec­tively at stake but the verisimil­i­tude of the final mon­tage.</p>
<p>The moral­ists of war, the hold­ers of high wartime values should not be too dis­cour­aged: the war is no less atro­cious for being only a sim­u­lacrum—the flesh suf­fers just the same, and the dead and former com­bat­ants are worth the same as in other wars. This objec­tive is always ful­filled, just like that of the chart­ing of ter­ri­to­ries and of dis­ci­plinary social­ity. What no longer exists is the adver­sity of the adver­saries, the real­ity of antag­o­nis­tic causes, the ide­o­log­i­cal seri­ous­ness of war. And also the real­ity of vic­tory or defeat, war being a process that tri­umphs well beyond these appear­ances.</p>
<p>In any case, the paci­fi­ca­tion (or the deter­rence) that dom­i­nates us today is beyond war and peace, it is that at every moment war and peace are equiv­a­lent. “War is peace,” said Orwell. There also, the two dif­fer­en­tial poles implode into each other, or recy­cle one another—a simul­tane­ity of con­tra­dic­tions that is at once the parody and the end of every dia­lec­tic. Thus one can com­pletely miss the truth of a war: namely, that it was fin­ished well before it started, that there was an end to war at the heart of the war itself, and that per­haps it never started. Many other events (the oil crisis, etc.) <em>never started</em>, never existed, except as arti­fi­cial occur­rences—abstract, ersatz, and as arti­facts of his­tory, catas­tro­phes and crises des­tined to main­tain a his­tor­i­cal invest­ment under hyp­no­sis. The media and the offi­cial <em>news ser­vice</em> are only there to main­tain the illu­sion of an actu­al­ity, of the real­ity of the stakes, of the objec­tiv­ity of facts. All the events are to be read back­ward, or one becomes aware (as with the Com­mu­nists “in power” in Italy the retro, post­hu­mous redis­cov­ery of the gulags and Soviet dis­si­dents like the almost con­tem­po­rary dis­cov­ery, by a mori­bund eth­nol­ogy, of the lost “dif­fer­ence” of Sav­ages) that all these things arrived too late, with a his­tory of delay, a spiral of delay, that they long ago exhausted their mean­ing and only live from an arti­fi­cial effer­ves­cence of signs, that all these events suc­ceed each other with­out logic, in the most con­tra­dic­tory, com­plete equiv­a­lence, in a pro­found indif­fer­ence to their con­se­quences (but this is because there are none: they exhaust them­selves in their spec­tac­u­lar pro­mo­tion)—all “news­reel” footage thus gives the sin­is­ter impres­sion of kitsch, of retro and porno at the same time doubt­less every­one knows this, and no one really accepts it. The real­ity of sim­u­la­tion is unbear­able—cru­eler than Artaud’s The­ater of Cru­elty, which was still an attempt to create a dra­maturgy of life, the last gasp of an ide­al­ity of the body, of blood, of vio­lence in a system that was already taking it away, toward a reab­sorp­tion of all the stakes with­out a trace of blood. For us the trick has been played. All dra­maturgy, and even all real writ­ing of cru­elty has dis­ap­peared. Sim­u­la­tion is the master, and we only have a right to the retro, to the phan­tom, par­o­dic reha­bil­i­ta­tion of all lost ref­er­en­tials. Every­thing still unfolds around us, in the cold light of deter­rence (includ­ing Artaud, who has the right like every­thing else to his revival, to a second exis­tence as the <em>ref­er­en­tial</em> of cru­elty).</p>
<p>This is why nuclear pro­lif­er­a­tion does not increase the risk of either an atomic clash or an acci­dent—save in the inter­val when the “young” powers could be tempted to make a non­de­ter­rent, “real” use of it (as the Amer­i­cans did in Hiroshima—but pre­cisely only they had a right to this “use value” of the bomb, all of those who have acquired it since will be deterred from using it by the very fact of pos­sess­ing it). Entry into the atomic club, so pret­tily named, very quickly effaces (as union­iza­tion does in the work­ing world) any incli­na­tion toward vio­lent inter­ven­tion. Respon­si­bil­ity, con­trol, cen­sure, self-deter­rence always grow more rapidly than the forces or the weapons at our dis­posal: this is the secret of the social order. Thus the very pos­si­bil­ity of par­a­lyz­ing a whole coun­try by flick­ing a switch <em>makes</em> it so that the elec­tri­cal engi­neers will never use this weapon: the whole myth of the total and rev­o­lu­tion­ary strike crum­bles at the very moment when the means are avail­able—but alas <em>pre­cisely because</em> those means are avail­able. Therein lies the whole process of deter­rence.</p>
<p>It is thus per­fectly prob­a­ble that one day we will see nuclear powers export atomic reac­tors, weapons, and bombs to every lat­i­tude. Con­trol by threat will be replaced by the more effec­tive strat­egy of paci­fi­ca­tion through the bomb and through the pos­ses­sion of the bomb. The “little” powers, believ­ing that they are buying their inde­pen­dent strik­ing force, will buy the virus of deter­rence, of their own deter­rence. The same goes for the atomic reac­tors that we have already sent them: so many neu­tron bombs knock­ing out all his­tor­i­cal vir­u­lence, all risk of explo­sion. In this sense, the nuclear every­where inau­gu­rates an accel­er­ated process of <em>implo­sion</em>, it freezes every­thing around it, it absorbs all living energy.</p>
<p>The nuclear is at once the cul­mi­nat­ing point of avail­able energy and the max­i­miza­tion of energy con­trol sys­tems. Lock­down and con­trol increase in direct pro­por­tion to (and undoubt­edly even faster than) lib­er­at­ing poten­tial­i­ties. This was already the aporia of the modern rev­o­lu­tion. It is still the abso­lute para­dox of the nuclear. Ener­gies freeze in their own fire, they deter them­selves. One can no longer imag­ine what project, what power, what strat­egy, what sub­ject could exist behind this enclo­sure, this vast sat­u­ra­tion of a system by its own forces, now neu­tral­ized, unus­able, unin­tel­li­gi­ble, non­ex­plo­sive except for the pos­si­bil­ity of <em>an explo­sion toward the center</em>, of an <em>implo­sion</em> where all these ener­gies would be abol­ished in a cat­a­strophic process (in the lit­eral sense, that is to say in the sense of a rever­sion of the whole cycle toward a min­i­mal point, of a rever­sion of ener­gies toward a min­i­mal thresh­old).</p>

<h1>History: a Retro Scenario</h1>
<div class="initial">
<p>In a vio­lent and con­tem­po­rary period of his­tory (let’s say between the two world wars and the cold war), it is myth that invades cinema as imag­i­nary con­tent. It is the golden age of despotic and leg­endary res­ur­rec­tions. Myth, chased from the real by the vio­lence of his­tory, finds refuge in cinema.</p>
</div>
<p>Today, it is his­tory itself that invades the cinema accord­ing to the same sce­nario—the his­tor­i­cal stake chased from our lives by this sort of immense neu­tral­iza­tion, which is dubbed peace­ful coex­is­tence on a global level, and paci­fied monotony on the quo­tid­ian level—this his­tory exor­cised by a slowly or bru­tally con­geal­ing soci­ety cel­e­brates its res­ur­rec­tion in force on the screen, accord­ing to the same process that used to make lost myths live again.</p>
<p>His­tory is our lost ref­er­en­tial, that is to say our myth. It is by virtue of this fact that it takes the place of myths on the screen. The illu­sion would be to con­grat­u­late one­self on this “aware­ness of his­tory on the part of cinema,” as one con­grat­u­lated one­self on the “entrance of pol­i­tics into the uni­ver­sity.” Same mis­un­der­stand­ing, same mys­ti­fi­ca­tion. The pol­i­tics that enter the uni­ver­sity are those that come from his­tory, a retro pol­i­tics, emp­tied of sub­stance and legal­ized in their super­fi­cial exer­cise, with the air of a game and a field of adven­ture, this kind of pol­i­tics is like sex­u­al­ity or per­ma­nent edu­ca­tion (or like social secu­rity in its time), that is, post­hu­mous lib­er­al­iza­tion.</p>
<p>The great event of this period, the great trauma, is this decline of strong ref­er­en­tials, these death pangs of the real and of the ratio­nal that open onto an age of sim­u­la­tion. Whereas so many gen­er­a­tions, and par­tic­u­larly the last, lived in the march of his­tory, in the euphoric or cat­a­strophic expec­ta­tion of a rev­o­lu­tion—today one has the impres­sion that his­tory has retreated, leav­ing behind it an indif­fer­ent nebula, tra­versed by cur­rents, but emp­tied of ref­er­ences. It is into this void that the phan­tasms of a past his­tory recede, the panoply of events, ide­olo­gies, retro fash­ions—no longer so much because people believe in them or still place some hope in them, but simply to res­ur­rect the period when <em>at least</em> there was his­tory, at least there was vio­lence (albeit fas­cist), when at least life and death were at stake. Any­thing serves to escape this void, this leukemia of his­tory and of pol­i­tics, this hem­or­rhage of values—it is in pro­por­tion to this dis­tress that all con­tent can be evoked pell-mell, that all pre­vi­ous his­tory is res­ur­rected in bulk—a con­trol­ling idea no longer selects, only nos­tal­gia end­lessly accu­mu­lates: war, fas­cism, the pageantry of the belle epoque, or the rev­o­lu­tion­ary strug­gles, every­thing is equiv­a­lent and is mixed indis­crim­i­nately in the same morose and fune­real exal­ta­tion, in the same retro fas­ci­na­tion. There is how­ever a priv­i­leg­ing of the imme­di­ately pre­ced­ing era (fas­cism, war, the period imme­di­ately fol­low­ing the war—the innu­mer­able films that play on these themes for us have a closer, more per­verse, denser, more con­fused essence). One can explain it by evok­ing the Freudian theory of fetishism (per­haps also a retro hypoth­e­sis). This trauma (loss of ref­er­en­tials) is sim­i­lar to the dis­cov­ery of the dif­fer­ence between the sexes in chil­dren, as seri­ous, as pro­found, as irre­versible: the fetishiza­tion of an object inter­venes to obscure this unbear­able dis­cov­ery, but pre­cisely, says Freud, this object is not just any object, it is often the last object per­ceived before the trau­matic dis­cov­ery. Thus the fetishized his­tory will prefer­ably be the one imme­di­ately pre­ced­ing our “irref­er­en­tial” era. Whence the omnipres­ence of fas­cism and of war in retro—a coin­ci­dence, an affin­ity that is not at all polit­i­cal; it is naive to con­clude that the evo­ca­tion of fas­cism sig­nals a cur­rent renewal of fas­cism (it is pre­cisely because one is no longer there, because one is in some­thing else, which is still less amus­ing, it is for this reason that fas­cism can again become fas­ci­nat­ing in its fil­tered cru­elty, aes­theti­cized by retro).<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p>His­tory thus made its tri­umphal entry into cinema, posthu­mously (the term <em>his­tor­i­cal</em> has under­gone the same fate: a “his­tor­i­cal” moment, mon­u­ment, con­gress, figure are in this way des­ig­nated as fos­sils). Its rein­jec­tion has no value as con­scious aware­ness but only as nos­tal­gia for a lost ref­er­en­tial.</p>
<p>This does not sig­nify that his­tory has never appeared in cinema as a pow­er­ful moment, as a con­tem­po­rary process, as insur­rec­tion and not as res­ur­rec­tion. In the “real” as in cinema, there was his­tory but there isn’t any any­more. Today, the his­tory that is “given back” to us (pre­cisely because it was taken from us) has no more of a rela­tion to a “his­tor­i­cal real” than neofig­u­ra­tion in paint­ing does to the clas­si­cal fig­u­ra­tion of the real. Neofig­u­ra­tion is an <em>invo­ca­tion</em> of resem­blance, but at the same time the fla­grant proof of the dis­ap­pear­ance of objects in their very rep­re­sen­ta­tion: <em>hyper­real</em>. Therein objects shine in a sort of hyper­re­sem­blance (like his­tory in con­tem­po­rary cinema) that makes it so that fun­da­men­tally they no longer resem­ble any­thing, except the empty figure of resem­blance, the empty form of rep­re­sen­ta­tion. It is a ques­tion of life or death: these objects are no longer either living or deadly. That is why they are so exact, so minute, frozen in the state in which a brutal loss of the real would have seized them. All, but not only, those his­tor­i­cal films whose very per­fec­tion is dis­qui­et­ing: <em>Chi­na­town, Three Days of the Condor, Barry Lyndon, 1900, All the Pres­i­dent’s Men</em>, etc. One has the impres­sion of it being a ques­tion of per­fect remakes, of extra­or­di­nary mon­tages that emerge more from a com­bi­na­tory cul­ture (or McLuhanesque mosaic), of large photo-, kino-, his­tori­cosyn­the­sis machines, etc., rather than one of ver­i­ta­ble films. Let’s under­stand each other: their qual­ity is not in ques­tion. The prob­lem is rather that in some sense we are left com­pletely indif­fer­ent. Take <em>The Last Pic­ture Show</em>: like me, you would have had to be suf­fi­ciently dis­tracted to have thought it to be an orig­i­nal pro­duc­tion from the 1950s: a very good film about the cus­toms in and the atmos­phere of the Amer­i­can small town. Just a slight sus­pi­cion: it was a little too good, more in tune, better than the others, with­out the psy­cho­log­i­cal, moral, and sen­ti­men­tal blotches of the films of that era. Stu­pe­fac­tion when one dis­cov­ers that it is a 1970s film, per­fect retro, purged, pure, the hyper­re­al­ist resti­tu­tion of 1950s cinema. One talks of remak­ing silent films, those will also doubtlessly be better than those of the period. A whole gen­er­a­tion of films is emerg­ing that will be to those one knew what the android is to man: mar­velous arti­facts, with­out weak­ness, pleas­ing sim­u­lacra that lack only the imag­i­nary, and the hal­lu­ci­na­tion inher­ent to cinema. Most of what we see today (the best) is already of this order. <em>Barry Lyndon</em> is the best exam­ple: one never did better, one will never do better in … in what? Not in evok­ing, not even in evok­ing, in <em>sim­u­lat­ing</em>. All the toxic radi­a­tion has been fil­tered, all the ingre­di­ents are there, in pre­cise doses, not a single error.</p>
<p>Cool, cold plea­sure, not even aes­thetic in the strict sense: func­tional plea­sure, equa­tional plea­sure, plea­sure of machi­na­tion. One only has to dream of Vis­conti (<em>Gué­pard, Senso,</em> etc., which in cer­tain respects make one think of <em>Barry Lyndon</em>) to grasp the dif­fer­ence, not only in style, but in the cin­e­mato­graphic act. In Vis­conti, there is mean­ing, his­tory, a sen­sual rhetoric, dead time, a pas­sion­ate game, not only in the his­tor­i­cal con­tent, but in the mise-en-scène. None of that in Kubrick, who manip­u­lates his film like a chess player, who makes an oper­a­tional sce­nario of his­tory. And this does not return to the old oppo­si­tion between the spirit of finesse and the spirit of geom­e­try: that oppo­si­tion still comes from the game and the stakes of mean­ing, whereas we are enter­ing an era of films that in them­selves no longer have mean­ing strictly speak­ing, an era of great syn­the­siz­ing machines of vary­ing geom­e­try.</p>
<p>Is there some­thing of this already in Leone’s West­erns? Maybe. All the reg­is­ters slide in that direc­tion. <em>Chi­na­town</em>: it is the detec­tive movie renamed by laser. It is not really a ques­tion of per­fec­tion: tech­ni­cal per­fec­tion can <em>be part of</em> mean­ing, and in that case it is nei­ther retro nor hyper­re­al­ist, it is an effect of art. Here, tech­ni­cal per­fec­tion is an effect of the model: it is one of the ref­er­en­tial tac­ti­cal values. In the absence of real <em>syntax</em> of mean­ing, one has noth­ing but the <em>tac­ti­cal</em> values of a group in which are admirably com­bined, for exam­ple, the CIA as a mytho­log­i­cal machine that does every­thing, Robert Red­ford as poly­va­lent star, social rela­tions as a nec­es­sary ref­er­ence to his­tory, tech­ni­cal vir­tu­os­ity as a nec­es­sary ref­er­ence to cinema.</p>
<p>The cinema and its tra­jec­tory: from the most fan­tas­tic or myth­i­cal to the real­is­tic and the hyper­re­al­is­tic.</p>
<p>The cinema in its cur­rent efforts is get­ting closer and closer, and with greater and greater per­fec­tion, to the abso­lute real, in its banal­ity, its verac­ity, in its naked obvi­ous­ness, in its bore­dom, and at the same time in its pre­sump­tion, in its pre­ten­sion to being the real, the imme­di­ate, the unsigni­fied, which is the cra­zi­est of under­tak­ings (sim­i­larly, func­tion­al­ism’s pre­ten­sion to des­ig­nat­ing—design—the great­est degree of cor­re­spon­dence between the object and its func­tion, and its use value, is a truly absurd enter­prise); no cul­ture has ever had toward its signs this naive and para­noid, puri­tan and ter­ror­ist vision.</p>
<p>Ter­ror­ism is always that of the real.</p>
<p>Con­cur­rently with this effort toward an abso­lute cor­re­spon­dence with the real, cinema also approaches an abso­lute cor­re­spon­dence with itself—and this is not con­tra­dic­tory: it is the very def­i­ni­tion of the hyper­real. Hypo­ty­po­sis and spec­u­lar­ity. Cinema pla­gia­rizes itself, recopies itself, remakes its clas­sics, retroac­ti­vates its orig­i­nal myths, remakes the silent film more per­fectly than the orig­i­nal, etc.: all of this is log­i­cal, <em>the cinema is fas­ci­nated by itself as a lost object as much as it (and we) are fas­ci­nated by the real as a lost ref­er­ent</em>. The cinema and the imag­i­nary (the nov­el­is­tic, the myth­i­cal, unre­al­ity, includ­ing the deliri­ous use of its own tech­nique) used to have a lively, dialec­ti­cal, full, dra­matic rela­tion. The rela­tion that is being formed today between the cinema and the real is an inverse, neg­a­tive rela­tion: it results from the loss of speci­ficity of one and of the other. The cold col­lage, the cool promis­cu­ity, the asex­ual nup­tials of two cold media that evolve in an asymp­totic line toward each other: the cinema attempt­ing to abol­ish itself in the cin­e­mato­graphic (or tele­vised) hyper­real.</p>
<p>His­tory is a strong myth, per­haps, along with the uncon­scious, the last great myth. It is a myth that at once sub­tended the pos­si­bil­ity of an “objec­tive” enchain­ment of events and causes and the pos­si­bil­ity of a nar­ra­tive enchain­ment of dis­course. The age of his­tory, if one can call it that, is also the age of the novel. It is this <em>fab­u­lous</em> char­ac­ter, the myth­i­cal energy of an event or of a nar­ra­tive, that today seems to be increas­ingly lost. Behind a per­for­ma­tive and demon­stra­tive logic: the obses­sion with his­tor­i­cal <em>fidelity</em>, with a per­fect ren­der­ing (as else­where the obses­sion with real time or with the minute quo­tid­i­ane­ity of Jeanne Hilmann doing the dishes), this neg­a­tive and impla­ca­ble fidelity to the mate­ri­al­ity of the past, to a par­tic­u­lar scene of the past or of the present, to the resti­tu­tion of an abso­lute sim­u­lacrum of the past or the present, which was sub­sti­tuted for all other value—we are all com­plic­i­tous in this, and this is irre­versible. Because cinema itself con­trib­uted to the dis­ap­pear­ance of his­tory, and to the advent of the archive. Pho­tog­ra­phy and cinema con­trib­uted in large part to the sec­u­lar­iza­tion of his­tory, to fixing it in its vis­i­ble, “objec­tive” form at the expense of the myths that once tra­versed it.</p>
<p>Today cinema can place all its talent, all its tech­nol­ogy in the ser­vice of rean­i­mat­ing what it itself con­trib­uted to liq­ui­dat­ing. It only res­ur­rects ghosts, and it itself is lost therein.</p>

<h1><em>Holocaust</em></h1>
<div class="initial">
<p>For­get­ting exter­mi­na­tion is part of exter­mi­na­tion, because it is also the exter­mi­na­tion of memory, of his­tory, of the social, etc. This for­get­ting is as essen­tial as the event, in any case unlo­cat­able by us, inac­ces­si­ble to us in its truth. This for­get­ting is still too dan­ger­ous, it must be effaced by an arti­fi­cial memory (today, every­where, it is arti­fi­cial mem­o­ries that efface the memory of man, that efface man in his own memory). This arti­fi­cial memory will be the restag­ing of exter­mi­na­tion—but late, much too late for it to be able to make real waves and pro­foundly dis­turb some­thing, and espe­cially, espe­cially through a medium that is itself cold, radi­at­ing for­get­ful­ness, deter­rence, and exter­mi­na­tion in a still more sys­tem­atic way, if that is pos­si­ble, than the camps them­selves. One no longer makes the Jews pass through the cre­ma­to­rium or the gas cham­ber, but through the sound track and image track, through the uni­ver­sal screen and the micro­pro­ces­sor. For­get­ting, anni­hi­la­tion, finally achieves its aes­thetic dimen­sion in this way—it is achieved in retro, finally ele­vated here to a mass level.</p>
</div>
<p>Even the type of socio­his­tor­i­cal dimen­sion that still remained for­got­ten in the form of guilt, of shame­ful latency, of the not-said, no longer exists, because now “every­one knows,” every­body has trem­bled and bawled in the face of exter­mi­na­tion—a sure sign that “that” will never again occur. But what one exor­cises in this way at little cost, and for the price of a few tears, will never in effect be repro­duced, because it has always been in the midst of cur­rently repro­duc­ing itself, and pre­cisely in the very form in which one pre­tends to denounce it, in the medium itself of this sup­posed exor­cism: tele­vi­sion. Same process of for­get­ting, of liq­ui­da­tion, of exter­mi­na­tion, same anni­hi­la­tion of mem­o­ries and of his­tory, same inverse, implo­sive radi­a­tion, same absorp­tion with­out an echo, same black hole as Auschwitz. And one would like to have us believe that TV will lift the weight of Auschwitz by making a col­lec­tive aware­ness radi­ate, whereas tele­vi­sion is its per­pet­u­a­tion in another guise, this time no longer under the aus­pices of a <em>site</em> of anni­hi­la­tion, but of a <em>medium</em> of deter­rence.</p>
<p>What no one wants to under­stand is that <em>Holo­caust is pri­mar­ily</em> (and exclu­sively) an event, or, rather, a <em>tele­vised</em> object (fun­da­men­tal rule of McLuhan’s, which must not be for­got­ten), that is to say, that one attempts to rekin­dle a <em>cold</em> his­tor­i­cal event, tragic but cold, the first major event of cold sys­tems, of cool­ing sys­tems, of sys­tems of deter­rence and exter­mi­na­tion that will then be deployed in other forms (includ­ing the cold war, etc.) and in regard to cold masses (the Jews no longer even con­cerned with their own death, and the even­tu­ally self-man­aged masses no longer even in revolt: deterred until death, deterred from their very own death) to rekin­dle this cold event through a cold medium, tele­vi­sion, and for the masses who are them­selves cold, who will only have the oppor­tu­nity for a tac­tile thrill and a post­hu­mous emo­tion, a deter­rent thrill as well, which will make them spill into for­get­ting with a kind of good aes­thetic con­science of the catas­tro­phe.</p>
<p>In order to rekin­dle all that, the whole polit­i­cal and ped­a­gog­i­cal orches­tra­tion that came from every direc­tion to attempt to give mean­ing to the event (the tele­vised event this time) was not at all exces­sive. Pan­icked black­mail­ing around the pos­si­ble con­se­quence of this broad­cast on the imag­i­na­tion of chil­dren and others. All the ped­a­gogues and social work­ers mobi­lized to filter the thing, as if there were some danger of infec­tion in this arti­fi­cial res­ur­rec­tion! The danger was really rather the oppo­site: from the cold to the cold, the social iner­tia of cold sys­tems, of TV in par­tic­u­lar. It was thus nec­es­sary that the whole world mobi­lize itself to remake the social, a hot social, heated dis­cus­sion, hence com­mu­ni­ca­tion, from the cold mon­ster of exter­mi­na­tion. One lacks stakes, invest­ment, his­tory, speech. That is the fun­da­men­tal prob­lem. The objec­tive is thus to pro­duce them at all cost, and this broad­cast served this pur­pose: to cap­ture the arti­fi­cial heat of a dead event to warm the dead body of the social. Whence the addi­tion of the sup­ple­men­tary medium to expand on the effect through feed­back: imme­di­ate polls sanc­tion­ing the mas­sive effect of the broad­cast, the col­lec­tive impact of the mes­sage—whereas it is well under­stood that the polls only verify the tele­vi­sual suc­cess of the medium itself. But this con­fu­sion will never be lifted.</p>
<p>From there, it is nec­es­sary to speak of the cold light of tele­vi­sion, why it is harm­less to the imag­i­na­tion (includ­ing that of chil­dren) because it no longer car­ries any imag­i­nary and this for the simple reason that <em>it is no longer an image</em>. By con­trast with the cinema, which is still blessed (but less and less so because more and more con­tam­i­nated by TV) with an intense imag­i­nary—because the cinema is an image. That is to say not only a screen and a visual form, but a <em>myth</em>, some­thing that still retains some­thing of the double, of the phan­tasm, of the mirror, of the dream, etc. Noth­ing of any of this in the “TV” image, which sug­gests noth­ing, which mes­mer­izes, which itself is noth­ing but a screen, not even that: a minia­tur­ized ter­mi­nal that, in fact, is imme­di­ately located in your head—you are the screen, and the TV watches you—it tran­sis­tor­izes all the neu­rons and passes through like a mag­netic tape—a tape, not an image.</p>

<section id="the-china-syndrome" class="level1">
<h1><em>The China Syndrome</em></h1>
<div class="initial">
<p>The fun­da­men­tal stake is at the level of tele­vi­sion and infor­ma­tion. Just as the exter­mi­na­tion of the Jews dis­ap­peared behind the tele­vised event <em>Holo­caust</em>—the cold medium of tele­vi­sion having been simply sub­sti­tuted for the cold system of exter­mi­na­tion one believed to be exor­cis­ing through it—so <em>The China Syn­drome</em> is a great exam­ple of the supremacy of the tele­vised event over the nuclear event which, itself, remains improb­a­ble and in some sense imag­i­nary.</p>
</div>
<p>Besides, the film shows this to be the case (with­out want­ing to): that TV is present pre­cisely where it hap­pens is not coin­ci­den­tal, it is the intru­sion of TV into the reac­tor that seems to give rise to the nuclear inci­dent—because TV is like its antic­i­pa­tion and its model in the every­day uni­verse: tele­fis­sion of the real and of the real world; because TV and infor­ma­tion in gen­eral are a form of catas­tro­phe in the formal and topo­log­i­cal sense Rene Thorn gives the word: a rad­i­cal qual­i­ta­tive change of a whole system. Or, rather, TV and the nuclear are of the same nature: behind the “hot” and negen­tropic con­cepts of energy and infor­ma­tion, they have the same power of deter­rence as cold sys­tems do. TV itself is also a nuclear process of chain reac­tion, but implo­sive: it cools and neu­tral­izes the mean­ing and the energy of events. Thus the nuclear, behind the pre­sumed risk of explo­sion, that is to say of hot catas­tro­phe, con­ceals a long, cold catas­tro­phe, the uni­ver­sal­iza­tion of a system of deter­rence.</p>
<p>At the end of the film again comes the second mas­sive intru­sion of the press and of TV that insti­gates the drama—the murder of the tech­ni­cal direc­tor by the Spe­cial Forces, a drama that sub­sti­tutes for the nuclear catas­tro­phe that will not occur.</p>
<p>The homol­ogy of the nuclear and of tele­vi­sion can be read directly in the images: noth­ing resem­bles the con­trol and telecom­mand head­quar­ters of the nuclear power sta­tion more than TV stu­dios, and the nuclear con­soles are com­bined with those of the record­ing and broad­cast­ing stu­dios in the same imag­i­nary. Thus every­thing takes place between these two poles: of the other “center,” that of the reac­tor, in prin­ci­ple the ver­i­ta­ble heart of the matter, we will know noth­ing; it, like the real, has van­ished and become illeg­i­ble, and is at bottom unim­por­tant in the film (when one attempts to sug­gest it to us, in its immi­nent catas­tro­phe, it does not work on the imag­i­nary plane: the drama unfolds on the screens and nowhere else).</p>
<p><em>Har­ris­burg</em>,<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <em>Water­gate</em>, and <em>Net­work</em>: such is the tril­ogy of <em>The China Syn­drome</em>—an indis­sol­u­ble tril­ogy in which one no longer knows which is the effect and which is the symp­tom: the ide­o­log­i­cal argu­ment (Water­gate effect), isn’t it noth­ing but the symp­tom of the nuclear (Har­ris­burg effect) or of the com­puter sci­ence model (Net­work effect)—the real (Har­ris­burg), isn’t it noth­ing but the symp­tom of the imag­i­nary (Net­work and China Syn­drome) or the oppo­site? Mar­velous indif­fer­en­ti­a­tion, ideal con­stel­la­tion of sim­u­la­tion. Mar­velous title, then, this <em>China Syn­drome</em>, because the reversibil­ity of symp­toms and their con­ver­gence in the same process con­sti­tute pre­cisely what we call a syn­drome—that it is Chi­nese adds the poetic and intel­lec­tual qual­ity of a conun­drum or sup­pli­ca­tion.</p>
<p>Obses­sive con­junc­tion of <em>The China Syn­drome</em> and Har­ris­burg. But is all that so invol­un­tary? With­out posit­ing mag­i­cal links between the sim­u­lacrum and the real, it is clear that the Syn­drome is not a stranger to the “real” acci­dent in Har­ris­burg, not accord­ing to a causal logic, but accord­ing to the rela­tions of con­ta­gion and silent anal­ogy that link the real to models and to sim­u­lacra: to tele­vi­sion’s <em>induc­tion</em> of the nuclear into the film cor­re­sponds, with a trou­bling obvi­ous­ness, the film’s <em>induc­tion</em> of the nuclear inci­dent in Har­ris­burg. Strange pre­ces­sion of a film over the real, the most sur­pris­ing that was given us to wit­ness: the real cor­re­sponded point by point to the sim­u­lacrum, includ­ing the sus­pended, incom­plete char­ac­ter of the catas­tro­phe, which is essen­tial from the point of view of deter­rence: the real arranged itself, in the image of the film, to pro­duce a <em>sim­u­la­tion</em> of catas­tro­phe.</p>
<p>From there to reverse our logic and to see in <em>The China Syn­drome</em> the ver­i­ta­ble event and in Har­ris­burg its sim­u­lacrum, there is only one step that must be cheer­fully taken. Because it is via the same logic that, in the film, nuclear real­ity arises from the tele­vi­sion effect, and that in “real­ity” Har­ris­burg arises from the <em>China Syn­drome</em> cinema effect.</p>
<p>But <em>The China Syn­drome</em> is also not the orig­i­nal pro­to­type of Har­ris­burg, one is not the sim­u­lacrum of which the other would be the real: there are only sim­u­lacra, and Har­ris­burg is a sort of second-order sim­u­la­tion. There is cer­tainly a chain reac­tion some­where, and we will per­haps die of it, but <em>this chain reac­tion is never that of the nuclear, it is that of sim­u­lacra</em> and of the sim­u­la­tion where all the energy of the real is effec­tively swal­lowed, no longer in a spec­tac­u­lar nuclear explo­sion, but in a secret and con­tin­u­ous implo­sion, and that today per­haps takes a more deathly turn than that of all the explo­sions that rock us.</p>
<p>Because an explo­sion is always a prom­ise, it is our hope: note how much, in the film as in Har­ris­burg, the whole world waits for some­thing to blow up, for destruc­tion to announce itself and remove us from this unname­able panic, from this panic of deter­rence that it exer­cises in the invis­i­ble form of the nuclear. That the “heart” of the reac­tor at last reveals its hot power of destruc­tion, that it reas­sures us about the pres­ence of energy, albeit cat­a­strophic, and bestows its <em>spec­ta­cle</em> on us. Because unhap­pi­ness is when there is no nuclear spec­ta­cle, no spec­ta­cle of nuclear energy in itself (Hiroshima is over), and it is for that reason that it is rejected—it would be per­fectly accepted if it lent itself to spec­ta­cle as pre­vi­ous forms of energy did. Parou­sia of catas­tro­phe: sub­stan­tial food for our mes­sianic libido.</p>
<p>But that is pre­cisely what will never happen. What will happen will never again be the explo­sion, but the implo­sion. No more energy in its spec­tac­u­lar and pathetic form—all the roman­ti­cism of the explo­sion, which had so much charm, being at the same time that of rev­o­lu­tion—but the cold energy of the sim­u­lacrum and of its dis­til­la­tion in home­o­pathic doses in the cold sys­tems of infor­ma­tion.</p>
<p>What else do the media dream of besides cre­at­ing the event simply by their pres­ence? Every­one decries it, but every­one is secretly fas­ci­nated by this even­tu­al­ity. Such is the logic of sim­u­lacra, it is no longer that of divine pre­des­ti­na­tion, it is that of the pre­ces­sion of models, but it is just as inex­orable. And it is because of this that events no longer have mean­ing: it is not that they are insignif­i­cant in them­selves, it is that they were pre­ceded by the model, with which their pro­cesses only coin­cided. Thus it would have been mar­velous to repeat the script for <em>The China Syn­drome</em> at Fes­sen­heim, during the visit offered to the jour­nal­ists by the EDF (French Elec­tric Com­pany), to repeat on this occa­sion the acci­dent linked to the magic eye, to the provoca­tive pres­ence of the media. Alas, noth­ing hap­pened. And on the other hand yes! so pow­er­ful is the logic of sim­u­lacra: a week after, the unions dis­cov­ered fis­sures in the reac­tors. Mir­a­cle of con­ta­gions, mir­a­cle of ana­logic chain reac­tions.</p>
<p>Thus, the essence of the film is not in any respect the Water­gate effect in the person of Jane Fonda, not in any respect TV as a means of expos­ing nuclear vices, but on the con­trary TV as the twin orbit and twin chain reac­tion of the nuclear one. Besides, just at the end—and there the film is unre­lent­ing in regard to its own argu­ment—when Jane Fonda makes the truth explode directly (max­i­mum Water­gate effect), her image is jux­ta­posed with what will inex­orably follow it and efface it on the screen: a com­mer­cial of some kind. The Net­work effect goes far beyond the Water­gate effect and spreads mys­te­ri­ously into the Har­ris­burg effect, that is to say not into the nuclear threat, but into the <em>sim­u­la­tion</em> of nuclear catas­tro­phe.</p>
<p>So, it is sim­u­la­tion that is effec­tive, never the real. The sim­u­la­tion of nuclear catas­tro­phe is the strate­gic result of this generic and uni­ver­sal under­tak­ing of deter­rence: accus­tom­ing the people to the ide­ol­ogy and the dis­ci­pline of abso­lute secu­rity—to the meta­physics of fis­sion and fis­sure. To this end the fis­sure must be a fic­tion. A real catas­tro­phe would delay things, it would con­sti­tute a ret­ro­grade inci­dent, of the explo­sive kind (with­out chang­ing the course of things: did Hiroshima per­cep­ti­bly delay, deter, the uni­ver­sal process of deter­rence?).</p>
<p>In the film, also, real fusion would be a bad argu­ment: the film would regress to the level of a dis­as­ter movie—weak by def­i­ni­tion, because it means return­ing things to their pure event. <em>The China Syn­drome</em>, itself, finds its strength in fil­ter­ing catas­tro­phe, in the dis­til­la­tion of the nuclear specter through the omnipresent hertzian relays of infor­ma­tion. It teaches us (once again with­out mean­ing to) that <em>nuclear catas­tro­phe does not occur, is not meant to happen</em>, in the real either, any more than the atomic clash was at the dawn­ing of the cold war. The equi­lib­rium of terror rests on the eter­nal defer­ral of the atomic clash. The atom and the nuclear are made to be dis­sem­i­nated for deter­rent ends, the power of catas­tro­phe must, instead of stupidly explod­ing, be dis­sem­i­nated in home­o­pathic, molec­u­lar doses, in the con­tin­u­ous reser­voirs of infor­ma­tion. Therein lies the true con­tam­i­na­tion: never bio­log­i­cal and radioac­tive, but, rather, a mental destruc­tura­tion through a mental strat­egy of catas­tro­phe.</p>
<p>If one looks care­fully, the film intro­duces us to this mental strat­egy, and in going fur­ther, it even deliv­ers a lesson dia­met­ri­cally opposed to that of Water­gate: if every strat­egy today is that of mental terror and of deter­rence tied to the sus­pen­sion and the eter­nal sim­u­la­tion of catas­tro­phe, then the only means of mit­i­gat­ing this sce­nario would be to <em>make</em> the catas­tro­phe arrive, to pro­duce or to repro­duce a <em>real</em> catas­tro­phe. To which Nature is at times given: in its inspired moments, it is God who through his cat­a­clysms unknots the equi­lib­rium of terror in which humans are impris­oned. Closer to us, this is what ter­ror­ism is occu­pied with as well: making real, pal­pa­ble vio­lence sur­face in oppo­si­tion to the invis­i­ble vio­lence of secu­rity. Besides, therein lies ter­ror­ism’s ambi­gu­ity.</p>

<section id="apocalypse-now" class="level1">
<h1><em>Apocalypse Now</em></h1>
<div class="initial">
<p>Cop­pola makes his film like the Amer­i­cans made war—in this sense, it is the best pos­si­ble tes­ti­mo­nial—with the same immod­er­a­tion, the same excess of means, the same mon­strous candor … and the same suc­cess. The war as entrench­ment, as tech­no­log­i­cal and psy­che­delic fan­tasy, the war as a suc­ces­sion of spe­cial effects, the war become film even before being filmed. The war abol­ishes itself in its tech­no­log­i­cal test, and for Amer­i­cans it was pri­mar­ily that: a test site, a gigan­tic ter­ri­tory in which to test their arms, their meth­ods, their power.</p>
</div>
<p>Cop­pola does noth­ing but that: test cinema’s <em>power of inter­ven­tion</em>, test the impact of a cinema that has become an immea­sur­able machin­ery of spe­cial effects. In this sense, his film is really the exten­sion of the war through other means, the pin­na­cle of this failed war, and its apoth­e­o­sis. The war became film, the film becomes war, the two are joined by their common hem­or­rhage into tech­nol­ogy.</p>
<p>The real war is waged by Cop­pola as it is by West­more­land: with­out count­ing the inspired irony of having forests and Phillip­ine vil­lages napalmed to retrace the hell of South Viet­nam. One revis­its every­thing through cinema and one begins again: the Molochian joy of film­ing, the sac­ri­fi­cial joy of so many mil­lions spent, of such a holo­caust of means, of so many mis­ad­ven­tures, and the remark­able para­noia that from the begin­ning con­ceived of this film as a his­tor­i­cal, <em>global</em> event, in which, in the mind of the cre­ator, the war in Viet­nam would have been noth­ing other than what it is, would not fun­da­men­tally have existed—and it is nec­es­sary for us to believe in this: the war in Viet­nam “in itself” per­haps in fact never hap­pened, it is a dream, a baroque dream of napalm and of the trop­ics, a psy­chotropic dream that had the goal nei­ther of a vic­tory nor of a policy at stake, but, rather, the sac­ri­fi­cial, exces­sive deploy­ment of a power already film­ing itself as it unfolded, per­haps wait­ing for noth­ing but con­se­cra­tion by a super­film, which com­pletes the mass-spec­ta­cle effect of this war.</p>
<p>No real dis­tance, no crit­i­cal sense, no desire for “rais­ing con­scious­ness” in rela­tion to the war: and in a sense this is the brutal qual­ity of this film—not being rotten with the moral psy­chol­ogy of war. Cop­pola can cer­tainly deck out his heli­copter cap­tain in a ridicu­lous hat of the light cav­alry, and make him crush the Viet­namese vil­lage to the sound of Wagner’s music—those are not crit­i­cal, dis­tant signs, they are immersed in the machin­ery, they are part of the spe­cial effect, and he him­self makes movies in the same way, with the same retro mega­lo­ma­nia, and the same non-sig­ni­fy­ing furor, with the same clown­ish effect in over­drive. But there it is, he hits us with that, it is there, it is bewil­der­ing, and one can say to one­self: how is such a horror pos­si­ble (not that of the war, but that of the film strictly speak­ing)? But there is no answer, there is no pos­si­ble ver­dict, and one can even rejoice in this mon­strous trick (exactly as with Wagner)—but one can always retrieve a tiny little idea that is not nasty, that is not a value judg­ment, but that tells you the war in Viet­nam and this film are cut from the same cloth, that noth­ing sep­a­rates them, that this film is part of the war—if the Amer­i­cans (seem­ingly) lost the other one, they cer­tainly won this one. <em>Apoc­a­lypse Now</em> is a global vic­tory. Cin­e­mato­graphic power equal and supe­rior to that of the indus­trial and mil­i­tary com­plexes, equal or supe­rior to that of the Pen­ta­gon and of gov­ern­ments.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden, the film is not with­out inter­est: it ret­ro­spec­tively illu­mi­nates (not even ret­ro­spec­tively, because the film is a phase of this war with­out end) what was already crazy about this war, irra­tional in polit­i­cal terms: the Amer­i­cans and the Viet­namese are already rec­on­ciled, right after the end of the hos­til­i­ties the Amer­i­cans offered eco­nomic aid, exactly as if they had anni­hi­lated the jungle and the towns, exactly as they are making their film today. One has under­stood noth­ing, nei­ther about the war nor about cinema (at least the latter) if one has not grasped this lack of dis­tinc­tion that is no longer either an ide­o­log­i­cal or a moral one, one of good and evil, but one of the reversibil­ity of both destruc­tion and pro­duc­tion, of the imma­nence of a thing in its very rev­o­lu­tion, of the organic metab­o­lism of all the tech­nolo­gies, of the carpet of bombs in the strip of film…</p>

<h1>The Beaubourg Effect: Implosion and Deterrence</h1>
<div class="initial">
<p>The Beaubourg effect, the Beaubourg machine, the Beaubourg <em>thing</em>—how to give it a name? Enigma of this car­cass of flux and signs, of net­works and cir­cuits—the final impulse to trans­late a struc­ture that no longer has a name, the struc­ture of social rela­tions given over to super­fi­cial ven­ti­la­tion (ani­ma­tion, self-man­age­ment, infor­ma­tion, media) and to an irre­versibly deep implo­sion. Mon­u­ment to the games of mass sim­u­la­tion, the Pom­pi­dou Center func­tions as an incin­er­a­tor absorb­ing all the cul­tural energy and devour­ing it—a bit like the black mono­lith in <em>2001</em>: insane con­vec­tion of all the con­tents that came there to be mate­ri­al­ized, to be absorbed, and to be anni­hi­lated.</p>
</div>
<p>All around, the neigh­bor­hood is noth­ing but a pro­tec­tive zone—remod­el­ing, dis­in­fec­tion, a snob­bish and hygienic design—but above all in a fig­u­ra­tive sense: it is a machine for making empti­ness. It is a bit like the real danger nuclear power sta­tions pose: not lack of secu­rity, pol­lu­tion, explo­sion, but a system of max­i­mum secu­rity that radi­ates around them, the pro­tec­tive zone of con­trol and deter­rence that extends, slowly but surely, over the ter­ri­tory—a tech­ni­cal, eco­log­i­cal, eco­nomic, geopo­lit­i­cal glacis. What does the nuclear matter? The sta­tion is a matrix in which an abso­lute model of secu­rity is elab­o­rated, which will encom­pass the whole social field, and which is fun­da­men­tally a model of deter­rence (it is the same one that con­trols us glob­ally, under the sign of peace­ful coex­is­tence and of the sim­u­la­tion of atomic danger).</p>
<p>The same model, with the same pro­por­tions, is elab­o­rated at the Center: cul­tural fis­sion, polit­i­cal deter­rence.</p>
<p>This said, the cir­cu­la­tion of fluids is unequal. Ven­ti­la­tion, cool­ing, elec­tri­cal net­works the “tra­di­tional” fluids cir­cu­late there very well. Already the cir­cu­la­tion of the human flux is less assured (the archaic solu­tion of esca­la­tors in plas­tic sleeves, one ought to be aspi­rated, pro­pelled, or some­thing, but with a mobil­ity that would be up to this baroque the­atri­cal­ity of fluids that is the source of the orig­i­nal­ity of the car­cass). As for the mate­rial of the works, of objects, of books and the so-called poly­va­lent inte­rior space, these no longer cir­cu­late at all. It is the oppo­site of Roissy, where from a futur­ist center of “spa­tial” design radi­at­ing toward “satel­lites,” etc., one ends up com­pletely flat in front of …tra­di­tional air­planes. But the inco­her­ence is the same. (What hap­pened to money, this other fluid, what hap­pened to its mode of cir­cu­la­tion, of emul­sion, of fall­out at Beaubourg?)</p>
<p>Same con­tra­dic­tion even in the behav­ior of the per­son­nel, assigned to the “poly­va­lent” space and with­out a pri­vate work space. On their feet and mobile, the people affect a cool demeanor, more supple, very con­tem­po­rary, adapted to the “struc­ture” of a “modern” space. Seated in their corner, which is pre­cisely not one, they exhaust them­selves secret­ing an arti­fi­cial soli­tude, remak­ing their “bubble.” Therein is also a great tactic of deter­rence: one con­demns them to using all their energy in this indi­vid­ual defense. Curi­ously, one thus finds the same con­tra­dic­tion that char­ac­ter­izes the Beaubourg thing: a mobile exte­rior, com­mut­ing, cool and modern—an inte­rior shriv­eled by the same old values.</p>
<p>This space of deter­rence, artic­u­lated on the ide­ol­ogy of vis­i­bil­ity, of trans­parency, of poly­va­lency, of con­sen­sus and con­tact, and sanc­tioned by the black­mail to secu­rity, is today, vir­tu­ally, that of all social rela­tions. All of social dis­course is there, and on this level as well as on that of the treat­ment of cul­ture, Beaubourg fla­grantly con­tra­dicts its explicit objec­tives, a nice mon­u­ment to our moder­nity. It is nice to think that the idea did not come to some rev­o­lu­tion­ary spirit, but to the logi­cians of the estab­lished order, deprived of all crit­i­cal intel­li­gence, and thus closer to the truth, capa­ble, in their obsti­nacy, of putting in place a machine that is fun­da­men­tally uncon­trol­lable, that in its very suc­cess escapes them, and that is the most exact reflec­tion, even in its con­tra­dic­tions, of the cur­rent state of things.</p>
<p>Cer­tainly, all the cul­tural con­tents of Beaubourg are anachro­nis­tic, because only an empty inte­rior could cor­re­spond to this archi­tec­tural enve­lope. The gen­eral impres­sion being that every­thing here has come out of a coma, that every­thing wants to be ani­ma­tion and is only rean­i­ma­tion, and that this is good because cul­ture is dead, a con­di­tion that Beaubourg admirably retraces, but in a dis­hon­est fash­ion, whereas one should have tri­umphantly accepted this death and erected a mon­u­ment or an anti-mon­u­ment equiv­a­lent to the phal­lic inanity of the Eiffel Tower in its time. Mon­u­ment to total dis­con­nec­tion, to hyper­re­al­ity and to the implo­sion of cul­ture-achieved today for us in the effect of tran­sis­tor­ized cir­cuits always threat­ened by a gigan­tic short cir­cuit.</p>
<p>Beaubourg is already an impe­rial com­pres­sion—figure of a cul­ture already crushed by its own weight—like moving auto­mo­biles sud­denly frozen in a geo­met­ric solid. Like the cars of Caesar, sur­vivors of an ideal acci­dent, no longer exter­nal, but inter­nal to the metal­lic and mechan­i­cal struc­ture, and which would have pro­duced tons of cubic scrap iron, where the chaos of tubes, levers, frames, of metal and human flesh inside is tai­lored to the geo­met­ric size of the small­est pos­si­ble space—thus the cul­ture of Beaubourg is ground, twisted, cut up, and pressed into its small­est simple ele­ments—a bundle of defunct trans­mis­sions and metab­o­lisms, frozen like a sci­ence-fic­tion mecanoid.</p>
<p>But instead of break­ing and com­press­ing all cul­ture here in this car­cass that in any case has the appear­ance of a com­pres­sion, instead of that, one <em>exhibits</em> Caesar there. One exhibits Dubuf­fet and the coun­ter­cul­ture, whose inverse sim­u­la­tion acts as a ref­er­en­tial for the defunct cul­ture. In this car­cass that could have served as a mau­soleum to the use­less oper­a­tional­ity of signs, one reex­hibits Tinguely’s ephemeral and autode­struc­tive machines under the sign of the eter­nity of cul­ture. Thus one neu­tral­izes every­thing together: Tinguely is embalmed in the museal insti­tu­tion, Beaubourg falls back on its sup­posed artis­tic con­tents.</p>
<p>For­tu­nately, this whole sim­u­lacrum of cul­tural values is anni­hi­lated in advance by the exter­nal archi­tec­ture.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Because this archi­tec­ture, with its net­works of tubes and the look it has of being an expo or world’s fair build­ing, with its (cal­cu­lated?) fragility deter­ring any tra­di­tional men­tal­ity or mon­u­men­tal­ity, overtly pro­claims that our time will never again be that of dura­tion, that our only tem­po­ral­ity is that of the accel­er­ated cycle and of recy­cling, that of the cir­cuit and of the tran­sit of fluids. Our only cul­ture in the end is that of hydro­car­bons, that of refin­ing, crack­ing, break­ing cul­tural mol­e­cules and of their recom­bi­na­tion into syn­the­sized prod­ucts. This, the Beaubourg Museum wishes to con­ceal, but the Beaubourg cadaver pro­claims. And this is what under­lies the beauty of the cadaver and the fail­ure of the inte­rior spaces. In any case, the very ide­ol­ogy of “cul­tural pro­duc­tion” is anti­thet­i­cal to all cul­ture, as is that of vis­i­bil­ity and of the poly­va­lent space: cul­ture is a site of the secret, of seduc­tion, of ini­ti­a­tion, of a restrained and highly rit­u­al­ized sym­bolic exchange. Noth­ing can be done about it. Too bad for the masses, too bad for Beaubourg.</p>
<p>What should, then, have been placed in Beaubourg?</p>
<p>Noth­ing. The void that would have sig­ni­fied the dis­ap­pear­ance of any cul­ture of mean­ing and aes­thetic sen­ti­ment. But this is still too roman­tic and destruc­tive, this void would still have had value as a mas­ter­piece of anti­cul­ture.</p>
<p>Per­haps revolv­ing strobe lights and gyro­scopic lights, stri­at­ing the space, for which the crowd would have pro­vided the moving base ele­ment?</p>
<p>In fact, Beaubourg illus­trates very well that an order of sim­u­lacra only estab­lishes itself on the alibi of the pre­vi­ous order. Here, a cadaver all in flux and sur­face con­nec­tions gives itself as con­tent a tra­di­tional cul­ture of depth. An order of prior sim­u­lacra (that of mean­ing) fur­nishes the empty sub­stance of a sub­se­quent order, which, itself, no longer even knows the dis­tinc­tion between sig­ni­fier and sig­ni­fied, nor between form and con­tent.</p>
<p>The ques­tion: “What should have been placed in Beaubourg?” is thus absurd. It cannot be answered because the top­i­cal dis­tinc­tion between inte­rior and exte­rior should no longer be posed. There lies our truth, the truth of Möbius-doubt­less an unre­al­iz­able utopia, but which Beaubourg still points to as right, to the degree to which any of its con­tents is a <em>coun­ter­mean­ing</em> and anni­hi­lated in advance by the form.</p>
<p>Yet-yet … if you had to have some­thing in Beaubourg—it should have been a labyrinth, a com­bi­na­tory, infi­nite library, an aleatory redis­tri­bu­tion of des­tinies through games or lot­ter­ies—in short, the uni­verse of Borges—or even the cir­cu­lar Ruins: the slowed-down enchain­ment of indi­vid­u­als dreamed up by each other (not a dream­world Dis­ney­land, a lab­o­ra­tory of prac­ti­cal fic­tion). An exper­i­men­ta­tion with all the dif­fer­ent pro­cesses of rep­re­sen­ta­tion: defrac­tion, implo­sion, slow motion, aleatory link­age and decou­pling—a bit like at the Explorato­rium in San Fran­cisco or in the novels of Philip K. Dick—in short a cul­ture of sim­u­la­tion and of fas­ci­na­tion, and not always one of pro­duc­tion and mean­ing: this is what might be pro­posed that would not be a mis­er­able anti­cul­ture. Is it pos­si­ble? Not here, evi­dently. But this cul­ture takes place else­where, every­where, nowhere. From today, the only real cul­tural prac­tice, that of the masses, ours (there is no longer a dif­fer­ence), is a manip­u­la­tive, aleatory prac­tice, a labyrinthine prac­tice of signs, and one that no longer has any mean­ing.</p>
<p>In another way, how­ever, it is not true that there is no coher­ence between form and con­tent at Beaubourg. It is true if one gives any cre­dence to the offi­cial cul­tural project. But exactly the oppo­site occurs there. Beaubourg is noth­ing but a huge effort to trans­mute this famous tra­di­tional cul­ture of mean­ing into the aleatory order of signs, into an order of sim­u­lacra (the third) that is com­pletely homo­ge­neous with the flux and pipes of the facade. And it is in order to pre­pare the masses for this new semi­ur­gic order that one brings them together here—with the oppo­site pre­text of accul­tur­at­ing them to mean­ing and depth.</p>
<p>One must thus start with this axiom: Beaubourg is a <em>mon­u­ment of cul­tural deter­rence</em>. Within a museal sce­nario that only serves to keep up the human­ist fic­tion of cul­ture, it is a ver­i­ta­ble fash­ion­ing of the death of cul­ture that takes place, and it is a ver­i­ta­ble <em>cul­tural mourn­ing</em> for which the masses are joy­ously gath­ered.</p>
<p>And they throw them­selves at it. There lies the supreme irony of Beaubourg: the masses throw them­selves at it not because they sali­vate for that cul­ture which they have been denied for cen­turies, but because they have for the first time the oppor­tu­nity to mas­sively par­tic­i­pate in this great mourn­ing of a cul­ture that, in the end, they have always detested.</p>
<p>The mis­un­der­stand­ing is there­fore com­plete when one denounces Beaubourg as a cul­tural mys­ti­fi­ca­tion of the masses. The masses, them­selves, rush there to enjoy this exe­cu­tion, this dis­mem­ber­ment, this oper­a­tional pros­ti­tu­tion of a cul­ture finally truly liq­ui­dated, includ­ing all coun­ter­cul­ture that is noth­ing but its apoth­e­o­sis. The masses rush toward Beaubourg as they rush toward dis­as­ter sites, with the same irre­sistible elan. Better: they are the dis­as­ter of Beaubourg. Their number, their stam­pede, their fas­ci­na­tion, their itch to see every­thing is objec­tively a deadly and cat­a­strophic behav­ior for the whole under­tak­ing. Not only does their weight put the build­ing in danger, but their adhe­sion, their curios­ity anni­hi­lates the very con­tents of this cul­ture of ani­ma­tion. This rush can no longer be mea­sured against what was pro­posed as the cul­tural objec­tive, it is its rad­i­cal nega­tion, in both its excess and suc­cess. It is thus the masses who assume the role of cat­a­strophic agent in this struc­ture of catas­tro­phe, it is <em>the masses them­selves who put an end to mass cul­ture</em>.</p>
<p>Cir­cu­lat­ing in the space of trans­parency, the masses are cer­tainly con­verted into flux, but at the same time, through their opac­ity and iner­tia, they put an end to this “poly­va­lent” space. One invites the masses to par­tic­i­pate, to sim­u­late, to play with the models—they go one better: they par­tic­i­pate and manip­u­late so well that they efface all the mean­ing one wants to give to the oper­a­tion and put the very infra­struc­ture of the edi­fice in danger. Thus, always a sort of parody, a hyper­sim­u­la­tion in response to cul­tural sim­u­la­tion, trans­forms the masses, who should only be the live­stock of cul­ture, into the agents of the exe­cu­tion of this cul­ture, of which Beaubourg was only the shame­ful incar­na­tion.</p>
<p>One must applaud this suc­cess of cul­tural deter­rence. All the antiartists, left­ists, and those who hold cul­ture in con­tempt have never even gotten close to approach­ing the dis­suas­sive effi­cacy of this mon­u­men­tal black hole that is Beaubourg. It is a truly rev­o­lu­tion­ary oper­a­tion, pre­cisely because it is invol­un­tary, insane and uncon­trolled, whereas any oper­a­tion meant to put an end to cul­ture only serves, as one knows, to res­ur­rect it.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, the only con­tent of Beaubourg is the masses them­selves, whom the build­ing treats like a con­verter, like a black box, or, in terms of input-output, just like a refin­ery han­dles petro­leum prod­ucts or a flood of unpro­cessed mate­rial.</p>
<p>It has never been so clear that the con­tent—here, cul­ture, else­where, infor­ma­tion or com­modi­ties—is noth­ing but the phan­tom sup­port for the oper­a­tion of the medium itself, whose func­tion is always to induce mass, to pro­duce a homo­ge­neous human and mental flux. An immense to-and-fro move­ment sim­i­lar to that of sub­ur­ban com­muters, absorbed and ejected at fixed times by their work­place. And it is pre­cisely work that is at issue here—a work of test­ing, polling, and directed inter­ro­ga­tion: the people come here to select objects—responses to all the ques­tions they might ask them­selves, or rather <em>they come them­selves in response to</em> the func­tional and directed ques­tion that the objects con­sti­tute. More than a chain of work it is thus a ques­tion of a pro­gram­matic dis­ci­pline whose con­straints have been effaced behind a veneer of tol­er­ance. Well beyond tra­di­tional insti­tu­tions of cap­i­tal, the hyper­mar­ket, or the Beaubourg “hyper­mar­ket of cul­ture,” is already the model of all future forms of con­trolled social­iza­tion: reto­tal­iza­tion in a homo­ge­neous space-time of all the dis­persed func­tions of the body and of social life (work, leisure, media cul­ture), retran­scrip­tion of all the con­tra­dic­tory cur­rents in terms of inte­grated cir­cuits. Space-time of a whole oper­a­tional sim­u­la­tion of social life.</p>
<p>For that, the mass of con­sumers must be equiv­a­lent or homol­o­gous to the mass of prod­ucts. It is the con­fronta­tion and the fusion of these two masses that occurs in the hyper­mar­ket as it does at Beaubourg, and that makes of them some­thing very dif­fer­ent from the tra­di­tional sites of cul­ture (mon­u­ments, muse­ums, gal­leries, libraries, com­mu­nity arts cen­ters, etc.). Here a crit­i­cal mass beyond which the com­mod­ity becomes hyper­com­mod­ity and cul­ture hyper­cul­ture, is elab­o­rated—that is to say no longer linked to dis­tinct exchanges or deter­mined needs, but to a kind of total descrip­tive uni­verse, or inte­grated cir­cuit that implo­sion tra­verses through and through—inces­sant cir­cu­la­tion of choices, read­ings, ref­er­ences, marks, decod­ing. Here cul­tural objects, as else­where the objects of con­sump­tion, have no other end than to main­tain you in a state of mass inte­gra­tion, of tran­sis­tor­ized flux, of a mag­ne­tized mol­e­cule. It is what one comes to learn in a hyper­mar­ket: hyper­re­al­ity of the com­mod­ity—it is what one comes to learn at Beaubourg: the hyper­re­al­ity of cul­ture.</p>
<p>Already with the tra­di­tional museum this cut­ting up, this regroup­ing, this inter­fer­ence of all cul­tures, this uncon­di­tional aes­theti­ciza­tion that con­sti­tutes the hyper­re­al­ity of cul­ture begins, but the museum is still a memory. Never, as it did here, has cul­ture lost its memory in the ser­vice of stock­pil­ing and func­tional redis­tri­bu­tion. And this trans­lates a more gen­eral fact: that through­out the “civ­i­lized” world the con­struc­tion of stock­piles of objects has brought with it the com­ple­men­tary process of stock­piles of people—the line, wait­ing, traf­fic jams, con­cen­tra­tion, the camp. That is “mass pro­duc­tion,” not in the sense of a mas­sive pro­duc­tion or for use by the masses, but the pro­duc­tion of the masses. The masses as the final prod­uct of all social­ity, and, at the same time, as putting an end to social­ity, because these masses that one wants us to believe are the social, are on the con­trary the site of the implo­sion of the social. <em>The masses are the increas­ingly dense sphere in which the whole social comes to be imploded, and to be devoured in an unin­ter­rupted process of sim­u­la­tion</em>.</p>
<p>Whence this con­cave mirror: it is from seeing the masses in the inte­rior that the masses will be tempted to rush in. Typ­i­cal mar­ket­ing method: the whole ide­ol­ogy of trans­parency here takes on its mean­ing. Or again: it is in stag­ing a reduced ideal model that one hopes for an accel­er­ated grav­i­ta­tion, an auto­matic agglu­ti­na­tion of cul­ture as an auto­matic agglom­er­a­tion of the masses. Same process: nuclear oper­a­tion of a chain reac­tion, or spec­u­lar oper­a­tion of white magic.</p>
<p>Thus for the first time, Beaubourg is at the level of cul­ture what the hyper­mar­ket is at the level of the com­mod­ity: <em>the per­fect cir­cu­la­tory oper­a­tor</em>, the demon­stra­tion of any­thing (com­mod­ity, cul­ture, crowd, com­pressed air) <em>through its own accel­er­ated cir­cu­la­tion</em>.</p>
<p>But if the supply of objects brings along with it the stock­pil­ing of men, the latent vio­lence in the supply of objects brings with it the inverse vio­lence of men.</p>
<p>Every stock is vio­lent, and there is a spe­cific vio­lence in any mass of men also, because of the fact that it implodes—a vio­lence proper to its grav­i­ta­tion, to its den­si­fi­ca­tion around its own locus of iner­tia. The masses are a locus of iner­tia and through that a locus of a com­pletely new, inex­pli­ca­ble vio­lence dif­fer­ent from explo­sive vio­lence.</p>
<p><em>Crit­i­cal mass</em>, implo­sive mass. Beyond thirty thou­sand it poses the risk of “bend­ing” the struc­ture of Beaubourg. If the masses mag­ne­tized by the struc­ture become a destruc­tive vari­able of the struc­ture itself—if those who con­ceived of the project wanted this (but how to hope for this?), if they thus pro­grammed the chance of putting an end with one blow to both archi­tec­ture and cul­ture—then Beaubourg con­sti­tutes the most auda­cious object and the most suc­cess­ful hap­pen­ing of the cen­tury!</p>
<p><em>Make Beaubourg bend!</em> New motto of a rev­o­lu­tion­ary order. Use­less to set fire to it, use­less to con­test it. Do it! It is the best way of destroy­ing it. The suc­cess of Beaubourg is no longer a mys­tery: the people go there <em>for that</em>, they throw them­selves on this build­ing, whose fragility already breathes catas­tro­phe, with the single goal of making it bend.</p>
<p>Cer­tainly they obey the imper­a­tive of deter­rence: one gives them an object to con­sume, a cul­ture to devour, an edi­fice to manip­u­late. But at the same time they expressly aim, and with­out know­ing it, at this anni­hi­la­tion. The onslaught is the only act the masses can pro­duce as such—a pro­jec­tile mass that chal­lenges the edi­fice of mass cul­ture, that wittly replies with its weight (that is to say with the char­ac­ter­is­tic most deprived of mean­ing, the stu­pid­est, the least cul­tural one they pos­sess) to the chal­lenge of cul­tur­al­ity thrown at it by Beaubourg. To the chal­lenge of mass accul­tur­a­tion to a ster­il­ized cul­ture, the masses respond with a destruc­tive irrup­tion, which is pro­longed in a brutal manip­u­la­tion. To mental deter­rence the masses respond with a direct phys­i­cal deter­rence. It is their own chal­lenge. Their ruse, which is to respond in the very terms by which they are solicited, but beyond that, to respond to the sim­u­la­tion in which one impris­ons them with an enthu­si­as­tic social process that sur­passes the objec­tives of the former and acts as a destruc­tive hyper­sim­u­la­tion.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>People have the desire to take every­thing, to pil­lage every­thing, to swal­low every­thing, to manip­u­late every­thing. Seeing, deci­pher­ing, learn­ing does not touch them. The only mas­sive affect is that of manip­u­la­tion. The orga­niz­ers (and the artists and intel­lec­tu­als) are fright­ened by this uncon­trol­lable watch­ful­ness, because they never count on any­thing but the appren­tice­ship of the masses to the <em>spec­ta­cle</em> of cul­ture. They never count on this active, destruc­tive fas­ci­na­tion, a brutal and orig­i­nal response to the gift of an incom­pre­hen­si­ble cul­ture, an attrac­tion that has all the char­ac­ter­is­tics of break­ing and enter­ing and of the vio­la­tion of a sanc­tu­ary.</p>
<p>Beaubourg could have or should have dis­ap­peared the day after the inau­gu­ra­tion, dis­man­tled and kid­napped by the crowd, which would have been the only pos­si­ble response to the absurd chal­lenge of the trans­parency and democ­racy of cul­ture—each person taking away a fetishized bolt of this cul­ture itself fetishized.</p>
<p>The people come to <em>touch</em>, they look as if they were touch­ing, their gaze is only an aspect of tac­tile manip­u­la­tion. It is cer­tainly a ques­tion of a tac­tile uni­verse, no longer a visual or dis­cur­sive one, and the people are directly impli­cated in a process: to manip­u­late/to be manip­u­lated, to ven­ti­late/to be ven­ti­lated, to cir­cu­late/to make cir­cu­late, which is no longer of the order of rep­re­sen­ta­tion, nor of dis­tance, nor of reflec­tion. It is some­thing that is part of panic, and of a world in panic.</p>
<p>Panic in slow motion, no exter­nal vari­able. It is the vio­lence inter­nal to a sat­u­rated ensem­ble. <em>Implo­sion</em>.</p>
<p>Beaubourg cannot even burn, every­thing is fore­seen. Fire, explo­sion, destruc­tion are no longer the imag­i­nary alter­na­tive to this type of build­ing. It is implo­sion that is the form of abol­ish­ing the “qua­ter­nary” world, both cyber­netic and com­bi­na­tory.</p>
<p>Sub­ver­sion, vio­lent destruc­tion is what cor­re­sponds to a mode of pro­duc­tion. To a uni­verse of net­works, of com­bi­na­tory theory, and of flow cor­re­spond rever­sal and implo­sion.</p>
<p>The same for insti­tu­tions, the state, power, etc. The dream of seeing all that explode by dint of con­tra­dic­tions is pre­cisely noth­ing but a dream. What is pro­duced in real­ity is that the insti­tu­tions implode of them­selves, by dint of ram­i­fi­ca­tions, feed­back, overde­vel­oped con­trol cir­cuits. <em>Power implodes</em>, this is its cur­rent mode of dis­ap­pear­ance.</p>
<p>Such is the case for the city. Fires, war, plague, rev­o­lu­tions, crim­i­nal marginal­ity, catas­tro­phes: the whole prob­lem­atic of the antic­ity, of the neg­a­tiv­ity inter­nal or exter­nal to the city, has some archaic rela­tion to its true mode of anni­hi­la­tion.</p>
<p>Even the sce­nario of the under­ground city—the Chi­nese ver­sion of the burial of struc­tures—is naive. The city does not repeat itself any longer accord­ing to a schema of <em>repro­duc­tion</em> still depen­dent on the gen­eral schema of pro­duc­tion, or accord­ing to a schema of resem­blance still depen­dent on a schema of rep­re­sen­ta­tion. (That is how one still restored after the Second World War.) The city no longer revives, even deep down it is remade start­ing from a sort of genetic code that makes it pos­si­ble to repeat it indef­i­nitely start­ing with an accu­mu­lated cyber­netic memory. Gone even the Bor­ge­sian utopia, of the map coex­ten­sive with the ter­ri­tory and dou­bling it in its entirety: today the sim­u­lacrum no longer goes by way of the double and of dupli­ca­tion, but by way of genetic minia­tur­iza­tion. End of rep­re­sen­ta­tion and implo­sion, there also, of the whole space in an infin­i­tes­i­mal memory, which for­gets noth­ing, and which belongs to no one. Sim­u­la­tion of an imma­nent, increas­ingly dense, irre­versible order, one that is poten­tially sat­u­rated and that will never again wit­ness the lib­er­at­ing explo­sion.</p>
<p>We <em>were</em> a cul­ture of lib­er­at­ing vio­lence (ratio­nal­ity). Whether it be that of cap­i­tal, of the lib­er­a­tion of pro­duc­tive forces, of the irre­versible exten­sion of the field of reason and of the field of value, of the con­quered and col­o­nized space includ­ing the uni­ver­sal—whether it be that of the rev­o­lu­tion, which antic­i­pates the future forms of the social and of the energy of the social—the schema is the same: that of an expand­ing sphere, whether through slow or vio­lent phases, that of a lib­er­ated energy—the imag­i­nary of radi­a­tion.</p>
<p>The vio­lence that accom­pa­nies it is that of a wider world: it is that of pro­duc­tion. This vio­lence is dialec­ti­cal, ener­getic, cathar­tic. It is the one we have learned to ana­lyze and that is famil­iar to us: that which traces the paths of the social and which leads to the sat­u­ra­tion of the whole field of the social. It is a vio­lence that is <em>deter­mined</em>, ana­lyt­i­cal, lib­er­at­ing.</p>
<p>A whole other vio­lence appears today, which we no longer know how to ana­lyze, because it escapes the tra­di­tional schema of explo­sive vio­lence: <em>implo­sive</em> vio­lence that no longer results from the exten­sion of a system, but from its sat­u­ra­tion and its retrac­tion, as is the case for phys­i­cal stel­lar sys­tems. A vio­lence that fol­lows an inor­di­nate den­si­fi­ca­tion of the social, the state of an over­reg­u­lated system, a net­work (of knowl­edge, infor­ma­tion, power) that is over­en­cum­bered, and of a hyper­trophic con­trol invest­ing all the inter­sti­tial path­ways.</p>
<p>This vio­lence is unin­tel­li­gi­ble to us because our whole imag­i­nary has as its axis the logic of expand­ing sys­tems. It is inde­ci­pher­able because unde­ter­mined. Per­haps it no longer even comes from the schema of inde­ter­mi­nacy. Because the aleatory models that have taken over from clas­si­cal models of deter­mi­na­tion and causal­ity are not fun­da­men­tally dif­fer­ent. They trans­late the pas­sage of defined sys­tems of expan­sion to sys­tems of pro­duc­tion and expan­sion on all levels—in a star or in a rhi­zome, it doesn’t matter—all the philoso­phies of the release of energy, of the irra­di­a­tion of inten­si­ties and of the molec­u­lar­iza­tion of desire go in the same direc­tion, that of a sat­u­ra­tion as far as the inter­sti­tial and the infin­ity of net­works. The dif­fer­ence from the molar to the molec­u­lar is only a mod­u­la­tion, the last per­haps, in the fun­da­men­tal ener­getic process of expand­ing sys­tems.</p>
<p>Some­thing else if we move from a mil­len­nial phase of the lib­er­a­tion and dis­con­nec­tion of ener­gies to a phase of implo­sion, after a kind of max­i­mum radi­a­tion (see Bataille’s con­cepts of loss and expen­di­ture in this sense, and the solar myth of an inex­haustible radi­a­tion, on which he founds his sump­tu­ary anthro­pol­ogy: it is the last explo­sive and radi­at­ing myth of our phi­los­o­phy, the last fire of arti­fice of a fun­da­men­tally gen­eral econ­omy, but this no longer has any mean­ing for us), to a phase of the <em>rever­sion of the social</em>—gigan­tic rever­sion of a field once the point of sat­u­ra­tion is reached. The stel­lar sys­tems also do not cease to exist once their radi­at­ing energy is dis­si­pated: they implode accord­ing to a process that is at first slow, and then pro­gres­sively accel­er­ates—they con­tract at a fab­u­lous speed, and become invo­lu­tive sys­tems, which absorb all the sur­round­ing ener­gies, so that they become black holes where the world as we know it, as radi­a­tion and indef­i­nite energy poten­tial, is abol­ished.</p>
<p>Per­haps the great metrop­o­lises—cer­tainly these if this hypoth­e­sis has any mean­ing—have become sites of implo­sion in this sense, sites of the absorp­tion and reab­sorp­tion of the social itself whose golden age, con­tem­po­ra­ne­ous with the double con­cept of cap­i­tal and rev­o­lu­tion, is doubt­less past. The social invo­lutes slowly or bru­tally, in a field of iner­tia, which already envelops the polit­i­cal. (The oppo­site energy?) One must stop one­self from taking implo­sion for a neg­a­tive process -inert, regres­sive—like the one lan­guage imposes on us by exalt­ing the oppo­site terms of evo­lu­tion, of rev­o­lu­tion. Implo­sion is a process spe­cific to incal­cu­la­ble con­se­quences. May 1968 was with­out a doubt the first implo­sive episode, that is to say con­trary to its rewrit­ing in terms of rev­o­lu­tion­ary prosopopeia, a first vio­lent reac­tion to the sat­u­ra­tion of the social, a retrac­tion, a chal­lenge to the hege­mony of the social, in con­tra­dic­tion, more­over, to the ide­ol­ogy of the par­tic­i­pants them­selves, who thought they were going fur­ther into the social—such is the imag­i­nary that still dom­i­nates us—and more­over a good part of the events of 1968 were still able to come from that rev­o­lu­tion­ary dynamic and explo­sive vio­lence, but some­thing else began at the same time there: the vio­lent invo­lu­tion of the social, deter­mined on that score, and the con­sec­u­tive and sudden implo­sion of power, in a brief moment of time, but that never stopped after­ward—fun­da­men­tally it is that which con­tin­ues, the implo­sion, of the social, of insti­tu­tions, of power—and not at all an unlo­cat­able rev­o­lu­tion­ary dynamic. On the con­trary, rev­o­lu­tion itself, the idea of rev­o­lu­tion also implodes, and this implo­sion car­ries weight­ier con­se­quences than the rev­o­lu­tion itself.</p>
<p>Cer­tainly, since 1968, and thanks to 1968, the social, like the desert, grows-par­tic­i­pa­tion, man­age­ment, gen­er­al­ized self-man­age­ment, etc.—but at the same time it comes close in mul­ti­ple places, more numer­ous than in 1968, to its dis­af­fec­tion and to its total rever­sion. Slow seism, intel­li­gi­ble to his­tor­i­cal reason.</p>

<h1>Hypermarket and Hypercommodity</h1>
<div class="initial">
<p>From thirty kilo­me­ters all around, the arrows point you toward these large triage cen­ters that are the hyper­mar­kets, toward this hyper­space of the com­mod­ity where in many regards a whole new social­ity is elab­o­rated. It remains to be seen how the hyper­mar­ket cen­tral­izes and redis­tributes a whole region and pop­u­la­tion, how it con­cen­trates and ratio­nal­izes time, tra­jec­to­ries, prac­tices—cre­at­ing an immense to-and-fro move­ment totally sim­i­lar to that of sub­ur­ban <em>com­muters</em>, absorbed and ejected at fixed times by their work place.</p>
</div>
<p>At the deep­est level, another kind of work is at issue here, the work of accul­tur­a­tion, of con­fronta­tion, of exam­i­na­tion, of the social code, and of the ver­dict: people go there to find and to select objects—responses to all the ques­tions they may ask them­selves; or, rather, they <em>them­selves</em> come <em>in response</em> to the func­tional and directed ques­tion that the objects con­sti­tute. The objects are no longer com­modi­ties: they are no longer even signs whose mean­ing and mes­sage one could deci­pher and appro­pri­ate for one­self, they are <em>tests</em>, they are the ones that inter­ro­gate us, and we are sum­moned to answer them, and the answer is included in the ques­tion. Thus all the mes­sages in the media func­tion in a sim­i­lar fash­ion: nei­ther infor­ma­tion nor com­mu­ni­ca­tion, but ref­er­en­dum, per­pet­ual test, cir­cu­lar response, ver­i­fi­ca­tion of the code.</p>
<p>No relief, no per­spec­tive, no van­ish­ing point where the gaze might risk losing itself, but a total screen where, in their unin­ter­rupted dis­play, the bill­boards and the prod­ucts them­selves act as equiv­a­lent and suc­ces­sive signs. There are employ­ees who are occu­pied solely in remak­ing the front of the stage, the sur­face dis­play, where a pre­vi­ous dele­tion by a con­sumer might have left some kind of a hole. The self-ser­vice also adds to this absence of depth: the same homo­ge­neous space, with­out medi­a­tion, brings together men and things—a space of direct manip­u­la­tion. But who manip­u­lates whom?</p>
<p>Even repres­sion is inte­grated as a sign in this uni­verse of sim­u­la­tion. Repres­sion become deter­rence is noth­ing but an extra sign in the uni­verse of per­sua­sion. The cir­cuits of sur­veil­lance cam­eras are them­selves part of the decor of sim­u­lacra. A per­fect sur­veil­lance on all fronts would require a heav­ier and more sophis­ti­cated mech­a­nism of con­trol than that of the store itself. It would not be prof­itable. It is thus an allu­sion to repres­sion, a “signal” of this order, that is put in place; this sign can thus coex­ist with all the others, and even with the oppo­site imper­a­tive, for exam­ple those that huge bill­boards express by invit­ing you to relax and to choose in com­plete seren­ity. These bill­boards, in fact, observe and surveil you as well, or as badly, as the “polic­ing” tele­vi­sion. The latter looks at you, you look at your­self in it, mixed with the others, it is the mirror with­out sil­ver­ing (<em>tain</em>) in the activ­ity of con­sump­tion, a game of split­ting in two and dou­bling that closes this world on itself.</p>
<p>The hyper­mar­ket cannot be sep­a­rated from the high­ways that sur­round and feed it, from the park­ing lots blan­keted in auto­mo­biles, from the com­puter ter­mi­nal—fur­ther still, in con­cen­tric cir­cles—from the whole town as a total func­tional screen of activ­i­ties. The hyper­mar­ket resem­bles a giant mon­tage fac­tory, because, instead of being linked to the chain of work by a con­tin­u­ous ratio­nal con­straint, the agents (or the patients), mobile and decen­tered, give the impres­sion of pass­ing through aleatory cir­cuits from one point of the chain to another. Sched­ules, selec­tion, buying are aleatory as well, in con­trast to work prac­tices. But it is still a ques­tion of a chain, of a pro­gram­matic dis­ci­pline, whose taboos are effaced beneath a veneer of tol­er­ance, facil­ity, and hyper­re­al­ity. The hyper­mar­ket is already, beyond the fac­tory and tra­di­tional insti­tu­tions of cap­i­tal, the model of all future forms of con­trolled social­iza­tion: reto­tal­iza­tion in a homo­ge­neous space—time of all the dis­persed func­tions of the body, and of social life (work, leisure, food, hygiene, trans­porta­tion, media, cul­ture); retran­scrip­tion of the con­tra­dic­tory fluxes in terms of inte­grated cir­cuits; space—time of a whole oper­a­tional sim­u­la­tion of social life, of a whole struc­ture of living and traf­fic.</p>
<p>A model of directed antic­i­pa­tion, the hyper­mar­ket (espe­cially in the United States) pre­ex­ists the met­ro­pol­i­tan area; it is what gives rise to metro areas, whereas the tra­di­tional market was in the heart of a city, a place where the city and the coun­try came to rub elbows. The hyper­mar­ket is the expres­sion of a whole life­style in which not only the coun­try but the town as well have dis­ap­peared to make room for “the metro area”—a com­pletely delim­ited func­tional urban zoning, of which the hyper­mar­ket is the equiv­a­lent, the micro­model, on the level of con­sump­tion. But the role of the hyper­mar­ket goes far beyond “con­sump­tion,” and the objects no longer have a spe­cific real­ity there: what is pri­mary is their serial, cir­cu­lar, spec­tac­u­lar arrange­ment—the future model of social rela­tions.</p>
<p>The “form” hyper­mar­ket can thus help us under­stand what is meant by the end of moder­nity. The large cities have wit­nessed the birth, in about a cen­tury (1850-1950), of a gen­er­a­tion of large, “modern” stores (many car­ried this name in one way or another), but this fun­da­men­tal mod­ern­iza­tion, linked to that of trans­porta­tion, did not over­throw the urban struc­ture. The cities remained cities, whereas the new cities are <em>satel­lited</em> by the hyper­mar­ket or the <em>shop­ping center</em>, ser­viced by a pro­grammed traf­fic net­work, and cease being cities to become met­ro­pol­i­tan areas. A new mor­pho­gen­e­sis has appeared, which comes from the cyber­netic kind (that is to say, repro­duc­ing at the level of the ter­ri­tory, of the home, of tran­sit, the sce­nar­ios of molec­u­lar con­trol that are those of the genetic code), and whose form is nuclear and satel­litic. The hyper­mar­ket as <em>nucleus</em>. The city, even a modern one, no longer absorbs it. It is the hyper­mar­ket that estab­lishes an orbit along which sub­ur­ban­izaiton moves. It func­tions as an <em>implant</em> for the new aggre­gates, as the uni­ver­sity or even the fac­tory some­times also does—no longer the nine­teenth-cen­tury fac­tory nor the decen­tral­ized fac­tory that, with­out break­ing the orbit of the city, is installed in the sub­urbs, but the mon­tage fac­tory, auto­mated by elec­tronic con­trols, that is to say cor­re­spond­ing to a totally deter­ri­to­ri­al­ized func­tion and mode of work. With this fac­tory, as with the hyper­mar­ket or the new uni­ver­sity, one is no longer deal­ing with func­tions (com­merce, work, knowl­edge, leisure) that are auton­o­mized and dis­placed (which still char­ac­ter­izes the “modern” unfold­ing of the city), but with a <em>model of the dis­in­te­gra­tion of func­tions</em>, of the inde­ter­mi­nacy of func­tions, and of the dis­in­te­gra­tion of the city itself, which is trans­planted out­side the city and treated as a hyper­real model, as the nucleus of a met­ro­pol­i­tan area based on syn­the­sis that no longer has any­thing to do with a city. Neg­a­tive satel­lites of the city that trans­late the end of the city, even of the modern city, as a deter­mined, qual­i­ta­tive space, as an orig­i­nal syn­the­sis of a soci­ety.</p>
<p>One could believe that this implan­ta­tion cor­re­sponds to the ratio­nal­iza­tion of diverse func­tions. But, in fact, from the moment a func­tion becomes hyper­spe­cial­ized to the point of being capa­ble of being pro­jected from every ele­ment on the ter­rain “keys in hand,” it loses the final­ity proper to it and becomes some­thing else alto­gether: a poly­func­tional nucleus, an ensem­ble of “black boxes” with mul­ti­ple input-out­puts, the locus of con­vec­tion and of destruc­tura­tion. These fac­to­ries and these uni­ver­si­ties are no longer fac­to­ries nor uni­ver­si­ties, and the hyper­mar­kets no longer have the qual­ity of a market. Strange new objects of which the nuclear power sta­tion is with­out a doubt the abso­lute model and from which radi­ates a kind of neu­tral­iza­tion of the ter­ri­tory, a power of deter­rence that, behind the appar­ent func­tion of these objects, with­out a doubt con­sti­tutes their fun­da­men­tal func­tion: the hyper­re­al­ity of func­tional nuclei that are no longer at all func­tional. These new objects are the poles of sim­u­la­tion around which is elab­o­rated, in con­trast to old train sta­tions, fac­to­ries, or tra­di­tional trans­porta­tion net­works, some­thing other than a “moder­nity”: a hyper­re­al­ity, a simul­tane­ity of all the func­tions, with­out a past, with­out a future, an oper­a­tional­ity on every level. And doubt­less also crises, or even new catas­tro­phes: May 1968 begins at Nan­terre, and not at the Sor­bonne, that is to say in a place where, for the first time in France, the hyper­func­tion­al­iza­tion “extra muros” of a place of learn­ing is equiv­a­lent to deter­ri­to­ri­al­iza­tion, to dis­af­fec­tion, to the loss of the func­tion and of the final­ity of knowl­edge in a pro­grammed neo­func­tional whole. There, a new, orig­i­nal vio­lence was born in response to the orbital satel­liza­tion of a model (knowl­edge, cul­ture) whose ref­er­en­tial is lost.</p>

<section id="the-implosion-of-meaning-in-the-media" class="level1">
<h1>The Implosion of Meaning in the Media</h1>
<div class="initial">
<p>We live in a world where there is more and more infor­ma­tion, and less and less mean­ing. Con­sider three hypothe­ses.</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Either information produces meaning (a negentropic factor), but cannot make up for the brutal loss of signification in every domain. Despite efforts to reinject message and content, meaning is lost and devoured faster than it can be reinjected. In this case, one must appeal to a base productivity to replace failing media. This is the whole ideology of free speech, of media broken down into innumerable individual cells of transmission, that is, into “antimedia” (pirate radio, etc.).</li>
<li>Or information has nothing to do with signification. It is something else, an operational model of another order, outside meaning and of the circulation of meaning strictly speaking. This is Shannon’s hypothesis: a sphere of information that is purely functional, a technical medium that does not imply any finality of meaning, and thus should also not be implicated in a value judgment. A kind of code, like the genetic code: it is what it is, it functions as it does, meaning is something else that in a sense comes after the fact, as it does for Monod in <em>Chance and Necessity</em>. In this case, there would simply be no significant relation between the inflation of information and the deflation of meaning.</li>
<li>Or, very much on the contrary, there is a rigorous and necessary correlation between the two, to the extent that information is directly destructive of meaning and signification, or that it neutralizes them. The loss of meaning is directly linked to the dissolving, dissuasive action of information, the media, and the mass media.</li>
</ul>
<p>The third hypoth­e­sis is the most inter­est­ing but flies in the face of every com­monly held opin­ion. Every­where social­iza­tion is mea­sured by the expo­sure to media mes­sages. Who­ever is under­ex­posed to the media is des­o­cial­ized or vir­tu­ally aso­cial. Every­where infor­ma­tion is thought to pro­duce an accel­er­ated cir­cu­la­tion of mean­ing, a plus value of mean­ing homol­o­gous to the eco­nomic one that results from the accel­er­ated rota­tion of cap­i­tal. Infor­ma­tion is thought to create com­mu­ni­ca­tion, and even if the waste is enor­mous, a gen­eral con­sen­sus would have it that nev­er­the­less, as a whole, there be an excess of mean­ing, which is redis­tributed in all the inter­stices of the social—just as con­sen­sus would have it that mate­rial pro­duc­tion, despite its dys­func­tions and irra­tional­i­ties, opens onto an excess of wealth and social pur­pose. We are all com­plic­i­tous in this myth. It is the alpha and omega of our moder­nity, with­out which the cred­i­bil­ity of our social orga­ni­za­tion would col­lapse. Well, <em>the fact is that it is col­laps­ing</em>, and for this very reason: because where we think that infor­ma­tion pro­duces mean­ing, the oppo­site occurs.</p>
<p>Infor­ma­tion devours its own con­tent. It devours com­mu­ni­ca­tion and the social. And for two rea­sons.</p>
<p>1. Rather than cre­at­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tion, <em>it exhausts itself in the act of stag­ing com­mu­ni­ca­tion</em>. Rather than pro­duc­ing mean­ing, it exhausts itself in the stag­ing of mean­ing. A gigan­tic process of sim­u­la­tion that is very famil­iar. The nondi­rec­tive inter­view, speech, lis­ten­ers who call in, par­tic­i­pa­tion at every level, black­mail through speech: “You are con­cerned, you are the event, etc.” More and more infor­ma­tion is invaded by this kind of phan­tom con­tent, this home­o­pathic graft­ing, this awak­en­ing dream of com­mu­ni­ca­tion. A cir­cu­lar arrange­ment through which one stages the desire of the audi­ence, the antithe­ater of com­mu­ni­ca­tion, which, as one knows, is never any­thing but the recy­cling in the neg­a­tive of the tra­di­tional insti­tu­tion, the inte­grated cir­cuit of the neg­a­tive. Immense ener­gies are deployed to hold this sim­u­lacrum at bay, to avoid the brutal des­im­u­la­tion that would con­front us in the face of the obvi­ous real­ity of a rad­i­cal loss of mean­ing.</p>
<p>It is use­less to ask if it is the loss of com­mu­ni­ca­tion that pro­duces this esca­la­tion in the sim­u­lacrum, or whether it is the sim­u­lacrum that is there first for dis­sua­sive ends, to short-cir­cuit in advance any pos­si­bil­ity of com­mu­ni­ca­tion (pre­ces­sion of the model that calls an end to the real). Use­less to ask which is the first term, there is none, it is a cir­cu­lar process—that of sim­u­la­tion, that of the hyper­real. The hyper­re­al­ity of com­mu­ni­ca­tion and of mean­ing. More real than the real, that is how the real is abol­ished. Thus not only com­mu­ni­ca­tion but the social func­tions in a closed cir­cuit, as a <em>lure</em>—to which the force of <em>myth</em> is attached. Belief, faith in infor­ma­tion attach them­selves to this tau­to­log­i­cal proof that the system gives of itself by dou­bling the signs of an unlo­cat­able real­ity.</p>
<p>But one can believe that this belief is as ambigu­ous as that which was attached to myths in ancient soci­eties. <em>One both believes and doesn’t</em>. One does not ask one­self, “I know very well, but still.” A sort of inverse sim­u­la­tion in the masses, in each one of us, cor­re­sponds to this sim­u­la­tion of mean­ing and of com­mu­ni­ca­tion in which this system encloses us. To this tau­tol­ogy of the system the masses respond with ambiva­lence, to deter­rence they respond with dis­af­fec­tion, or with an always enig­matic belief. Myth exists, but one must guard against think­ing that people believe in it: this is the trap of crit­i­cal think­ing that can only be exer­cised if it pre­sup­poses the naivete and stu­pid­ity of the masses.</p>
<p>2. Behind this exac­er­bated mise-en-scène of com­mu­ni­ca­tion, the mass media, the pres­sure of infor­ma­tion pur­sues an irre­sistible destruc­tura­tion of the social.</p>
<p>Thus infor­ma­tion dis­solves mean­ing and dis­solves the social, in a sort of neb­u­lous state ded­i­cated not to a sur­plus of inno­va­tion, but, on the con­trary, to total entropy.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus the media are pro­duc­ers not of social­iza­tion, but of exactly the oppo­site, of the implo­sion of the social in the masses. And this is only the macro­scopic exten­sion of the <em>implo­sion of mean­ing</em> at the micro­scopic level of the sign. This implo­sion should be ana­lyzed accord­ing to McLuhan’s for­mula, <em>the medium is the mes­sage</em>, the con­se­quences of which have yet to be exhausted.</p>
<p>That means that all con­tents of mean­ing are absorbed in the only dom­i­nant form of the medium. Only the medium can make an event—what­ever the con­tents, whether they are con­form­ist or sub­ver­sive. A seri­ous prob­lem for all coun­ter­in­for­ma­tion, pirate radios, anti­me­dia, etc. But there is some­thing even more seri­ous, which McLuhan him­self did not see. Because beyond this neu­tral­iza­tion of all con­tent, one could still expect to manip­u­late the medium in its form and to trans­form the real by using the impact of the medium as form. If all the con­tent is wiped out, there is per­haps still a sub­ver­sive, rev­o­lu­tion­ary use value of the <em>medium as such</em>. That is—and this is where McLuhan’s for­mula leads, pushed to its limit—there is not only an implo­sion of the mes­sage in the medium, there is, in the same move­ment, the implo­sion of the medium itself in the real, the implo­sion <em>of the medium and of the real</em> in a sort of hyper­real nebula, in which even the def­i­ni­tion and dis­tinct action of the medium can no longer be deter­mined.</p>
<p>Even the “tra­di­tional” status of the media them­selves, char­ac­ter­is­tic of moder­nity, is put in ques­tion. McLuhan’s for­mula, <em>the medium is the mes­sage</em>, which is the key for­mula of the era of sim­u­la­tion (the medium is the mes­sage—the sender is the receiver—the cir­cu­lar­ity of all poles—the end of panop­tic and per­spec­ti­val space—such is the alpha and omega of our moder­nity), this very for­mula must be imag­ined at its limit where, after all the con­tents and mes­sages have been volatilized in the medium, it is the medium itself that is volatilized as such. Fun­da­men­tally, it is still the mes­sage that lends cred­i­bil­ity to the medium, that gives the medium its deter­mined, dis­tinct status as the inter­me­di­ary of com­mu­ni­ca­tion. With­out a mes­sage, the medium also falls into the indef­i­nite state char­ac­ter­is­tic of all our great sys­tems of judg­ment and value. A single <em>model</em>, whose effi­cacy is imme­di­ate, simul­ta­ne­ously gen­er­ates the mes­sage, the medium, and the “real.”</p>
<p>Finally, <em>the medium is the mes­sage</em> not only sig­ni­fies the end of the mes­sage, but also the end of the medium. There are no more media in the lit­eral sense of the word (I’m speak­ing par­tic­u­larly of elec­tronic mass media)—that is, of a medi­at­ing power between one real­ity and another, between one state of the real and another. Nei­ther in con­tent, nor in form. Strictly, this is what implo­sion sig­ni­fies. The absorp­tion of one pole into another, the short-cir­cuit­ing between poles of every dif­fer­en­tial system of mean­ing, the era­sure of dis­tinct terms and oppo­si­tions, includ­ing that of the medium and of the real—thus the impos­si­bil­ity of any medi­a­tion, of any dialec­ti­cal inter­ven­tion between the two or from one to the other. Cir­cu­lar­ity of all media effects. Hence the impos­si­bil­ity of mean­ing in the lit­eral sense of a uni­lat­eral vector that goes from one pole to another. One must envis­age this crit­i­cal but orig­i­nal sit­u­a­tion at its very limit: it is the only one left us. It is use­less to dream of rev­o­lu­tion through con­tent, use­less to dream of a rev­e­la­tion through form, because the medium and the real are now in a single nebula whose truth is inde­ci­pher­able.</p>
<p>The fact of this implo­sion of con­tents, of the absorp­tion of mean­ing, of the evanes­cence of the medium itself, of the reab­sorp­tion of every dia­lec­tic of com­mu­ni­ca­tion in a total cir­cu­lar­ity of the model, of the implo­sion of the social in the masses, may seem cat­a­strophic and des­per­ate. But this is only the case in light of the ide­al­ism that dom­i­nates our whole view of infor­ma­tion. We all live by a pas­sion­ate ide­al­ism of mean­ing and of com­mu­ni­ca­tion, by an ide­al­ism of com­mu­ni­ca­tion through mean­ing, and, from this per­spec­tive, it is truly the <em>catas­tro­phe of mean­ing</em> that lies in wait for us.</p>
<p>But one must real­ize that “catas­tro­phe” has this “cat­a­strophic” mean­ing of end and anni­hi­la­tion only in rela­tion to a linear vision of accu­mu­la­tion, of pro­duc­tive final­ity, imposed on us by the system. Ety­mo­log­i­cally, the term itself only sig­ni­fies the cur­va­ture, the wind­ing down to the bottom of a cycle that leads to what one could call the “hori­zon of the event,” to an impass­able hori­zon of mean­ing: beyond that noth­ing takes place <em>that has mean­ing for us</em>—but it suf­fices to get out of this ulti­ma­tum of mean­ing in order for the catas­tro­phe itself to no longer seem like a final and nihilis­tic day of reck­on­ing, such as it func­tions in our con­tem­po­rary imag­i­nary.</p>
<p>Beyond mean­ing, there is the fas­ci­na­tion that results from the neu­tral­iza­tion and the implo­sion of mean­ing. Beyond the hori­zon of the social, there are the masses, which result from the neu­tral­iza­tion and the implo­sion of the social.</p>
<p>What is essen­tial today is to eval­u­ate this double chal­lenge—the chal­lenge of the masses to mean­ing and their silence (which is not at all a pas­sive resis­tance)—the chal­lenge to mean­ing that comes from the media and its fas­ci­na­tion. All the mar­ginal, alter­na­tive efforts to revive mean­ing are sec­ondary in rela­tion to that chal­lenge.</p>
<p>Evi­dently, there is a para­dox in this inex­tri­ca­ble con­junc­tion of the masses and the media: do the media neu­tral­ize mean­ing and pro­duce unformed [<em>informe</em>] or informed [<em>infor­mée</em>] masses, or is it the masses who vic­to­ri­ously resist the media by direct­ing or absorb­ing all the mes­sages that the media pro­duce with­out respond­ing to them? Some­time ago, in “Requiem for the Media,” I ana­lyzed and con­demned the media as the insti­tu­tion of an irre­versible model of com­mu­ni­ca­tion <em>with­out a response</em>. But today? This absence of a response can no longer be under­stood at all as a strat­egy of power, but as a coun­ter­strat­egy of the masses them­selves when they encounter power. What then?</p>
<p>Are the mass media on the side of power in the manip­u­la­tion of the masses, or are they on the side of the masses in the liq­ui­da­tion of mean­ing, in the vio­lence per­pe­trated on mean­ing, and in fas­ci­na­tion? Is it the media that induce fas­ci­na­tion in the masses, or is it the masses who direct the media into the spec­ta­cle? Mogadishu-Stammheim: the media make them­selves into the vehi­cle of the moral con­dem­na­tion of ter­ror­ism and of the exploita­tion of fear for polit­i­cal ends, but simul­ta­ne­ously, in the most com­plete ambi­gu­ity, they prop­a­gate the brutal charm of the ter­ror­ist act, they are them­selves ter­ror­ists, inso­far as they them­selves march to the tune of seduc­tion (cf. Umberto Eco on this eter­nal moral dilemma: how can one not speak of ter­ror­ism, how can one find a <em>good use</em> of the media—<em>there is none</em>). The media carry mean­ing and coun­ter­mean­ing, they manip­u­late in all direc­tions at once, noth­ing can con­trol this process, they are the vehi­cle for the sim­u­la­tion inter­nal to the system and the sim­u­la­tion that destroys the system, accord­ing to an abso­lutely Möbian and cir­cu­lar logic—and it is exactly like this. There is no alter­na­tive to this, no log­i­cal res­o­lu­tion. Only a log­i­cal <em>exac­er­ba­tion</em> and a cat­a­strophic res­o­lu­tion.</p>
<p>With one cau­tion. We are face to face with this system in a double sit­u­a­tion and insol­u­ble double bind—exactly like chil­dren faced with the demands of the adult world. Chil­dren are simul­ta­ne­ously required to con­sti­tute them­selves as auton­o­mous sub­jects, respon­si­ble, free and con­scious, and to con­sti­tute them­selves as sub­mis­sive, inert, obe­di­ent, con­form­ing objects. The child resists on all levels, and to a con­tra­dic­tory demand he responds with a double strat­egy. To the demand of being an object, he opposes all the prac­tices of dis­obe­di­ence, of revolt, of eman­ci­pa­tion; in short, a total claim to sub­ject­hood. To the demand of being a sub­ject he opposes, just as obsti­nately and effi­ca­ciously, an object’s resis­tance, that is to say, exactly the oppo­site: child­ish­ness, hyper­con­formism, total depen­dence, pas­siv­ity, idiocy. Nei­ther strat­egy has more objec­tive value than the other. The sub­ject-resis­tance is today uni­lat­er­ally val­orized and viewed as pos­i­tive—just as in the polit­i­cal sphere only the prac­tices of free­dom, eman­ci­pa­tion, expres­sion, and the con­sti­tu­tion of a polit­i­cal sub­ject are seen as valu­able and sub­ver­sive. But this is to ignore the equal, and with­out a doubt supe­rior, impact of all the object prac­tices, of the renun­ci­a­tion of the sub­ject posi­tion and of mean­ing—pre­cisely the prac­tices of the masses—that we bury under the derisory terms of alien­ation and pas­siv­ity. The lib­er­at­ing prac­tices respond to <em>one</em> of the aspects of the system, to the con­stant ulti­ma­tum we are given to con­sti­tute our­selves as pure objects, but they do not respond at all to the other demand, that of con­sti­tut­ing our­selves as sub­jects, of lib­er­at­ing our­selves, express­ing our­selves at what­ever cost, of voting, pro­duc­ing, decid­ing, speak­ing, par­tic­i­pat­ing, play­ing the game—a form of black­mail and ulti­ma­tum just as seri­ous as the other, even more seri­ous today. To a system whose argu­ment is oppres­sion and repres­sion, the strate­gic resis­tance is the lib­er­at­ing claim of sub­ject­hood. But this strat­egy is more reflec­tive of the ear­lier phase of the system, and even if we are still con­fronted with it, it is no longer the strate­gic ter­rain: the cur­rent argu­ment of the system is to max­i­mize speech, the max­i­mum pro­duc­tion of mean­ing. Thus the strate­gic resis­tance is that of the refusal of mean­ing and of the spoken word—or of the hyper­con­formist sim­u­la­tion of the very mech­a­nisms of the system, which is a form of refusal and of non-recep­tion. It is the strat­egy of the masses: it is equiv­a­lent to return­ing to the system its own logic by dou­bling it, to reflect­ing mean­ing, like a mirror, with­out absorb­ing it. This strat­egy (if one can still speak of strat­egy) pre­vails today, because it was ush­ered in by that phase of the system which pre­vails.</p>
<p>To choose the wrong strat­egy is a seri­ous matter. All the move­ments that only play on lib­er­a­tion, eman­ci­pa­tion, on the res­ur­rec­tion of a sub­ject of his­tory, of the group, of the word based on “con­scious­ness rais­ing,” indeed a “rais­ing of the uncon­scious” of sub­jects and of the masses, do not see that they are going in the direc­tion of the system, whose imper­a­tive today is pre­cisely the over­pro­duc­tion and regen­er­a­tion of mean­ing and of speech.</p>

<p>Today what we are expe­ri­enc­ing is the absorp­tion of all vir­tual modes of expres­sion into that of adver­tis­ing. All orig­i­nal cul­tural forms, all deter­mined lan­guages are absorbed in adver­tis­ing because it has no depth, it is instan­ta­neous and instan­ta­neously for­got­ten. Tri­umph of super­fi­cial form, of the small­est common denom­i­na­tor of all sig­ni­fi­ca­tion, degree zero of mean­ing, tri­umph of entropy over all pos­si­ble tropes. The lowest form of energy of the sign. This unar­tic­u­lated, instan­ta­neous form, with­out a past, with­out a future, with­out the pos­si­b­lity of meta­mor­pho­sis, has power over all the others. All cur­rent forms of activ­ity tend toward adver­tis­ing and most exhaust them­selves therein. Not nec­es­sar­ily adver­tis­ing itself, the kind that is pro­duced as such—but the <em>form</em> of adver­tis­ing, that of a sim­pli­fied oper­a­tional mode, vaguely seduc­tive, vaguely con­sen­sual (all the modal­i­ties are con­fused therein, but in an atten­u­ated, agi­tated mode). More gen­er­ally, the form of adver­tis­ing is one in which all par­tic­u­lar con­tents are annulled at the very moment when they can be tran­scribed into each other, whereas what is inher­ent to “weighty” enun­ci­a­tions, to artic­u­lated forms of mean­ing (or of style) is that they cannot be trans­lated into each other, any more than the rules of a game can be.</p>
</div>
<p>This long move­ment toward trans­lata­bil­ity and thus toward a com­plete com­bi­na­to­rial, which is that of <em>the super­fi­cial trans­parency of every­thing</em>, of their abso­lute <em>adver­tis­ing</em> (of which pro­fes­sional adver­tis­ing is, once again, only an episodic form), can be read in the vicis­si­tudes of pro­pa­ganda.</p>
<p>The whole scope of adver­tis­ing and pro­pa­ganda comes from the Octo­ber Rev­o­lu­tion and the market crash of 1929. Both lan­guages of the masses, issu­ing from the mass pro­duc­tion of ideas, or com­modi­ties, their reg­is­ters, sep­a­rate at first, pro­gres­sively con­verge. Pro­pa­ganda becomes the mar­ket­ing and mer­chan­dis­ing of idea-forces, of polit­i­cal men and par­ties with their “trade­mark image.” Pro­pa­ganda approaches adver­tis­ing as it would the vehic­u­lar model of the only great and ver­i­ta­ble idea-force of this com­pet­ing soci­ety, the com­mod­ity and the mark. This con­ver­gence defines a soci­ety—ours—in which there is no longer any dif­fer­ence between the eco­nomic and the polit­i­cal, because the same lan­guage reigns in both, from one end to the other; a soci­ety there­fore where the polit­i­cal econ­omy, lit­er­ally speak­ing, is finally fully real­ized. That is to say dis­solved as a spe­cific power (as an his­tor­i­cal mode of social con­tra­dic­tion), res­o­lute, absorbed in a lan­guage with­out con­tra­dic­tions, like a dream, because tra­versed by purely super­fi­cial inten­si­ties.</p>
<p>A sub­se­quent stage is crossed once the very lan­guage of the social, after that of the polit­i­cal, becomes con­fused with this fas­ci­nat­ing solic­i­ta­tion of an agi­tated lan­guage, once the social turns itself into adver­tis­ing, turns itself over to the pop­u­lar vote by trying to impose its trade­mark image. From the his­tor­i­cal des­tiny that it was, the social itself fell to the level of a “col­lec­tive enter­prise” secur­ing its pub­lic­ity on every level. See what sur­plus value of the social each adver­tise­ment tries to pro­duce: <em>werben werben</em> (adver­tise adver­tise)—the solic­i­ta­tion of the social every­where, present on walls, in the hot and blood­less voices of female radio announc­ers, in the accents of the sound track and in the mul­ti­ple tonal­i­ties of the image track that is played every­where before our eyes. A social­ity every­where present, an abso­lute social­ity finally real­ized in abso­lute adver­tis­ing —that is to say, also totally dis­solved, a ves­tige of social­ity hal­lu­ci­nated on all the walls in the sim­pli­fied form of a demand of the social that is imme­di­ately met by the echo of adver­tis­ing. The social as a script, whose bewil­dered audi­ence we are.</p>
<p>Thus the form of adver­tis­ing has imposed itself and devel­oped at the expense of all the other lan­guages as an increas­ingly neu­tral, equiv­a­lent rhetoric, with­out affects, as an “asyn­tac­tic nebula,” Yves Stour­dzé would say, which envelops us from every side (and which at the same time elim­i­nates the hotly con­tro­ver­sial prob­lem of “belief” and effi­cacy: it does not offer sig­ni­fieds in which to invest, it offers a sim­pli­fied equiv­a­lence of all the for­merly dis­tinc­tive signs, and deters them with this very equiv­a­lence). This defines the limits of adver­tis­ing’s cur­rent power and the con­di­tions of its dis­ap­pear­ance, since today adver­tis­ing is no longer a stake, it has both “entered into our cus­toms” and at the same time escaped the social and moral dra­maturgy that it still rep­re­sented twenty years ago.</p>
<p>It is not that people no longer believe in it or that they have accepted it as rou­tine. It is that if its fas­ci­na­tion once lay in its power to sim­plify all lan­guages, today this power is stolen from it by another type of lan­guage that is even more sim­pli­fied and thus more func­tional: the lan­guages of com­puter sci­ence. The sequence model, the sound track, and the image track that adver­tis­ing, along with the other big media, offers us—the model of the com­bi­na­tory, equal dis­tri­bu­tion of all dis­courses that it pro­poses—this still rhetor­i­cal con­tin­uum of sounds, signs, sig­nals, slo­gans that it erects as a total envi­ron­ment is largely over­taken, pre­cisely in its func­tion of sim­u­la­tion, by the mag­netic tape, by the elec­tronic con­tin­uum that is in the process of being sil­hou­et­ted against the hori­zon of the end of this cen­tury. Micro­pro­cess­ing, dig­i­tal­ity, cyber­netic lan­guages go much fur­ther in the direc­tion of the abso­lute sim­pli­fi­ca­tion of pro­cesses than adver­tis­ing did on its humble still imag­i­nary and spec­tac­u­lar-level. And it is because these sys­tems go fur­ther that today they polar­ize the fas­ci­na­tion that for­merly devolved on adver­tis­ing. It is infor­ma­tion, in the sense of data pro­cess­ing, that will put an end to, that is already putting an end to the reign of adver­tis­ing. That is what inspires fear, and what is thrilling. The “thrill” of adver­tis­ing has been dis­placed onto com­put­ers and onto the minia­tur­iza­tion of every­day life by com­puter sci­ence.</p>
<p>The antic­i­pa­tory illus­tra­tion of this trans­for­ma­tion was Philip K. Dick’s papula—that tran­sis­tor­ized adver­tis­ing implant, a sort of broad­cast­ing leech, an elec­tronic par­a­site that attaches itself to the body and that is very hard to get rid of. But the papula is still an inter­me­di­ary form: it is already a kind of incor­po­rated pros­the­sis, but it still inces­santly repeats adver­tis­ing mes­sages. A hybrid, then, but a pre­fig­u­ra­tion of the psy­chotropic and dat­apro­cess­ing net­works of the auto­matic pilot­ing of indi­vid­u­als, next to which the “con­di­tion­ing” by adver­tis­ing looks like a delight­ful change in for­tune.</p>
<p>Cur­rently, the most inter­est­ing aspect of adver­tis­ing is its dis­ap­pear­ance, its dilu­tion as a spe­cific form, or even as a medium. Adver­tis­ing is no longer (was it ever?) a means of com­mu­ni­ca­tion or of infor­ma­tion. Or else it is over­taken by the mad­ness spe­cific to overde­vel­oped sys­tems, that of voting for itself at each moment, and thus of par­o­dy­ing itself. If at a given moment, the com­mod­ity was its own pub­lic­ity (there was no other) today pub­lic­ity has become its own com­mod­ity. It is con­fused with itself (and the eroti­cism with which it ridicu­lously cloaks itself is noth­ing but the auto­erotic index of a system that does noth­ing but des­ig­nate itself—whence the absur­dity of seeing in it an “alien­ation” of the female body).</p>
<p>As a medium become its own mes­sage (which makes it so that now there is a demand for adver­tis­ing in and of itself, and that thus the ques­tion of “believ­ing” in it or not is no longer even posed), adver­tis­ing is com­pletely in unison with the social, whose his­tor­i­cal neces­sity has found itself absorbed by the pure and simple <em>demand</em> for the social: a demand that the social func­tion like a busi­ness, a group of ser­vices, a mode of living or of sur­vival (the social must be saved just as nature must be pre­served: the social is our niche)—whereas for­merly it was a sort of rev­o­lu­tion in its very project. This is cer­tainly lost: the social has lost pre­cisely this power of illu­sion, it has fallen into the reg­is­ter of supply and demand, just as work has passed from being a force antag­o­nis­tic to cap­i­tal to the simple status of employ­ment, that is to say of goods (even­tu­ally rare) and ser­vices just like the others. One can thus create adver­tis­ing for work, the joy of find­ing work, just as one will be able to create adver­tis­ing for the social. And, today, true adver­tis­ing lies therein: in the design of the social, in the exal­ta­tion of the social in all its forms, in the fierce, obsti­nate reminder of a social, the need for which makes itself rudely felt.</p>
<p>Folk­loric dances in the metro, innu­mer­able cam­paigns for secu­rity, the slogan “tomor­row I work” accom­pa­nied by a smile for­merly reserved for leisure time, and the adver­tis­ing sequence for the elec­tion to the Prud-hommes (an indus­trial tri­bunal): “I don’t let anyone choose for me”—an Ubuesque slogan, one that rang so spec­tac­u­larly falsely, with a mock­ing lib­erty, that of prov­ing the social while deny­ing it. It is not by chance that adver­tis­ing, after having, for a long time, car­ried an implicit ulti­ma­tum of an eco­nomic kind, fun­da­men­tally saying and repeat­ing inces­santly, “I buy, I con­sume, I take plea­sure,” today repeats in other forms, “I vote, I par­tic­i­pate, I am present, I am con­cerned”—mirror of a para­dox­i­cal mock­ery, mirror of the indif­fer­ence of all <em>public</em> sig­ni­fi­ca­tion.</p>
<p>The oppo­site panic: one knows that the social can be dis­solved in a panic reac­tion, an uncon­trol­lable chain reac­tion. But it can also be dis­solved in the oppo­site reac­tion, a chain reac­tion of <em>iner­tia</em>, each microuni­verse sat­u­rated, autoreg­u­lated, com­put­er­ized, iso­lated in auto­matic pilot. Adver­tis­ing is the pre­fig­u­ra­tion of this: the first man­i­fes­ta­tion of an unin­ter­rupted thread of signs, like ticker tape—each iso­lated in its iner­tia. Dis­af­fected, but sat­u­rated. Desen­si­tized, but ready to crack. It is in such a uni­verse that what Vir­ilio calls the aes­thetic of dis­ap­pear­ance gath­ers strength, that the fol­low­ing being to appear: frac­tal objects, frac­tal forms, fault zones that follow sat­u­ra­tion, and thus a process of mas­sive rejec­tion, of the abre­ac­tion or stupor of a soci­ety purely trans­par­ent to itself. Like the signs in adver­tis­ing, one is geared down, one becomes trans­par­ent or uncount­able, one becomes diaphanous or rhi­zomic to escape the point of iner­tia—one is placed in orbit, one is plugged in, one is satel­lized, one is archived—paths cross: there is the sound track, the image track, just as in life there is the work track, the leisure track, the trans­port track, etc., all enveloped in the adver­tis­ing track. Every­where there are three or four paths, and you are at the cross­roads. Super­fi­cial sat­u­ra­tion and fas­ci­na­tion.</p>
<p>Because fas­ci­na­tion remains. One need only look at Las Vegas, the abso­lute adver­tis­ing city (of the 1950s, of the crazy years of adver­tis­ing, which has retained the charm of that era, today retro in some sense, because adver­tis­ing is secretly con­demned by the pro­gram­matic logic that will give rise to very dif­fer­ent cities). When one sees Las Vegas rise whole from the desert in the radi­ance of adver­tis­ing at dusk, and return to the desert when dawn breaks, one sees that adver­tis­ing is not what bright­ens or dec­o­rates the walls, it is what effaces the walls, effaces the streets, the facades, and all the archi­tec­ture, effaces any sup­port and any depth, and that it is this liq­ui­da­tion, this reab­sorp­tion of every­thing into the sur­face (what­ever signs cir­cu­late there) that plunges us into this stu­pe­fied, hyper­real eupho­ria that we would not exchange for any­thing else, and that is the empty and inescapable form of seduc­tion.</p>

<p>Adver­tis­ing, there­fore, like infor­ma­tion: destroyer of inten­si­ties, accel­er­a­tor of iner­tia. See how all the arti­fices of mean­ing and of non­mean­ing are repeated in it with las­si­tude, like all the pro­ce­dures, all the mech­a­nisms of the lan­guage of com­mu­ni­ca­tion (the func­tion of con­tact: you under­stand me? Are you look­ing at me? It will speak!—the ref­er­en­tial func­tion, the poetic func­tion even, the allu­sion, the irony, the game of words, the uncon­scious), how all of that is staged exactly like sex in pornog­ra­phy, that is to say with­out any faith, with the same tired obscen­ity. That is why, now, it is use­less to ana­lyze adver­tis­ing as lan­guage, because some­thing else is hap­pen­ing there: a dou­bling of lan­guage (and also of images), to which nei­ther lin­guis­tics nor semi­ol­ogy cor­re­spond, because they func­tion on the ver­i­ta­ble oper­a­tion of mean­ing, with­out the slight­est sus­pi­cion of this car­i­cat­u­ral exor­bi­tance of all the func­tions of lan­guage, this open­ing onto an immense field of the mock­ery of signs, “con­sumed” as one says in their mock­ery, for their mock­ery and the col­lec­tive spec­ta­cle of their game with­out stakes—just as porno is a hyper­tro­phied fic­tion of sex con­sumed in its mock­ery, for its mock­ery, a col­lec­tive spec­ta­cle of the inanity of sex in its baroque assump­tion (it was the baroque that invented this tri­umphal mock­ery of stucco, fixing the dis­ap­pear­ance of the reli­gious in the orgasm of stat­ues).</p>
<p>Where is the golden age of the adver­tis­ing project? The exal­ta­tion of an object by an image, the exal­ta­tion of buying and of con­sump­tion through the sump­tu­ary spend­ing of adver­tis­ing? What­ever the sub­ju­ga­tion of pub­lic­ity to the man­age­ment of cap­i­tal (but this aspect of the ques­tion—that of the social and eco­nomic impact of pub­lic­ity—always remains unre­solved and fun­da­men­tally insol­u­ble), it always had more than a sub­ju­gated func­tion, it was a mirror held out to the uni­verse of polit­i­cal econ­omy and of the com­mod­ity, it was for a moment their glo­ri­ous imag­i­nary, that of a torn-up world, but an expand­ing one. But the uni­verse of the com­mod­ity is no longer this one: it is a world both sat­u­rated and in invo­lu­tion. In one blow, it lost both its tri­umphal imag­i­nary, and, from the mirror stage, it passed in some sense to the stage of mourn­ing.</p>
<p>There is no longer a stag­ing of the com­mod­ity: there is only its obscene and empty form. And adver­tis­ing is the illus­tra­tion of this sat­u­rated and empty form.</p>
<p>That is why adver­tis­ing no longer has a ter­ri­tory. Its recov­er­able forms no longer have any mean­ing. The Forum des Halles, for exam­ple, is a gigan­tic adver­tis­ing unit—an oper­a­tion of pub­lic­i­tude. It is not the adver­tis­ing of a par­tic­u­lar person, of any firm, the Forum also does not have the status of a ver­i­ta­ble mall or archi­tec­tural whole, any more than Beaubourg is, in the end, a cul­tural center: these strange objects, these super­gad­gets simply demon­strate that our social mon­u­men­tal­ity has become adver­tis­ing. And it is some­thing like the Forum that best illus­trates what adver­tis­ing has become, what the <em>public domain</em> has become.</p>
<p>The com­mod­ity is buried, like infor­ma­tion is in archives, like archives are in bunkers, like mis­siles are in atomic silos.</p>
<p>Gone the happy and dis­played com­mod­ity, now that it flees the sun, and sud­denly it is like a man who has lost his shadow. Thus the Forum des Halles closely resem­bles a funeral home—the fune­real luxury of a com­mod­ity buried, trans­par­ent, in a black sun. Sar­coph­a­gus of the com­mod­ity.</p>
<p>Every­thing there is sepul­chral—white, black, salmon marble. A bunker-case-in deep, snob­bish, dull black—min­eral under­ground space. Total absence of fluids; there is no longer even a liquid gadget like the veil of water at Parly 2,<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> which at least fooled the eye—here not even an amus­ing sub­terfuge, only pre­ten­tious mourn­ing is staged. (The only amus­ing idea in the whole thing is pre­cisely the human and his shadow who walk in trompe l’oeil on the ver­ti­cal dais of con­crete: a gigan­tic, beau­ti­ful gray, open-air canvas, serv­ing as a frame to the trompe l’oeil, this wall lives with­out having wished to, in con­trast to the family vault of haute cou­ture and <em>prêt-à-porter</em> that con­sti­tutes the Forum. This shadow is beau­ti­ful because it is an allu­sion in con­trast to the infe­rior world that has lost its shadow.)</p>
<p>All that one could hope for, once this sacred space was opened to the public, and for fear that pol­lu­tion, as in the Las­caux caves, cause it to dete­ri­o­rate irre­me­di­a­bly (think of the waves of people from the RER),<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> was that it be imme­di­ately closed off to cir­cu­la­tion and cov­ered with a defin­i­tive shroud in order to keep this tes­ti­mony to a civ­i­liza­tion that has arrived, after having passed the stage of the *apogee, at the stage of the hypogee, of the com­mod­ity, intact. There is a fresco here that traces the long route tra­versed, start­ing with the man of Tau­tavel pass­ing through Marx and Ein­stein to arrive at Dorothée Bis… Why not save this fresco from decom­po­si­tion? Later the spele­ol­o­gists will redis­cover it, at the same time that they dis­cover a cul­ture that chose to bury itself in order to defini­tively escape its own shadow, to bury its seduc­tions and its arti­fices as if it were already con­se­crat­ing them to another world.</p>

<section id="clone-story" class="level1">
<h1>Clone Story</h1>
<div class="initial">
<p>Of all the pros­the­ses that mark the his­tory of the body, the double is doubt­less the oldest. But the double is pre­cisely not a pros­the­sis: it is an imag­i­nary figure, which, just like the soul, the shadow, the mirror image, haunts the sub­ject like his other, which makes it so that the sub­ject is simul­ta­ne­ously itself and never resem­bles itself again, which haunts the sub­ject like a subtle and always averted death. This is not always the case, how­ever: when the double mate­ri­al­izes, when it becomes vis­i­ble, it sig­ni­fies immi­nent death.</p>
</div>
<p>In other words, the imag­i­nary power and wealth of the double—the one in which the strange­ness and at the same time the inti­macy of the sub­ject to itself are played out (<em>heim­lich/unheim­lich</em>)—rests on its imma­te­ri­al­ity, on the fact that it is and remains a phan­tasm. Every­one can dream, and must have dreamed his whole life, of a per­fect dupli­ca­tion or mul­ti­pli­ca­tion of his being, but such copies only have the power of dreams, and are destroyed when one attempts to force the dream into the real. The same is true of the (primal) scene of seduc­tion: it only func­tions when it is phan­tasmed, rere­mem­bered, never real. It belonged to our era to wish to exor­cise this phan­tasm like the others, that is to say to want to real­ize, mate­ri­al­ize it in flesh and bone and, in a com­pletely con­trary way, to change the game of the double from a subtle exchange of death with the Other into the eter­nity of the Same.</p>
<p>Clones. Cloning. Human cut­tings ad infini­tum, each indi­vid­ual cell of an organ­ism capa­ble of again becom­ing the matrix of an iden­ti­cal indi­vid­ual. In the United States, a child was born a few months ago like a gera­nium: from cut­tings. The first clone child (the lin­eage of an indi­vid­ual via veg­e­tal mul­ti­pli­ca­tion). The first born from a single cell of a single indi­vid­ual, his “father,” the sole pro­gen­i­tor, of which he would be the exact replica, the per­fect twin, the double.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>Dream of an eter­nal twin­ing sub­sti­tuted for sexual pro­cre­ation that is linked to death. Cel­lu­lar dream of scis­si­par­ity, the purest form of parent­age, because it finally allows one to do with­out the other, to go from the same to the same (one still has to use the uterus of a woman, and a pitted ovum, but this sup­port is ephemeral, and in any case anony­mous: a female pros­the­sis could replace it). Mono­cel­lu­lar utopia which, by way of genet­ics, allows com­plex beings to achieve the des­tiny of pro­to­zoas.</p>
<p>What, if not a death drive, would push sexed beings to regress to a form of repro­duc­tion prior to sex­u­a­tion (besides, isn’t it this form of scis­si­par­ity, this repro­duc­tion and pro­lif­er­a­tion through pure con­ti­gu­ity that is for us, in the depths of our imag­i­nary, death and the death drive—what denies sex­u­al­ity and wants to anni­hi­late it, sex­u­al­ity being the car­rier of life, that is to say of a crit­i­cal and mortal form of repro­duc­tion?) and that, at the same time, would push them meta­phys­i­cally to deny all alter­ity, all alter­ation of the Same in order to aim solely for the per­pet­u­a­tion of an iden­tity, a trans­parency of the genetic inscrip­tion no longer even sub­ject to the vicis­si­tudes of pro­cre­ation?</p>
<p>Let’s leave the death drive aside. Is it a ques­tion of the phan­tasm of auto-gen­e­sis? No, because such a fan­tasy still passes through the fig­ures of the mother and the father, <em>sexed</em> parental fig­ures that the sub­ject can dream of effac­ing by sub­sti­tut­ing him­self for them, but with­out deny­ing the sym­bolic struc­ture of pro­cre­ation at all: becom­ing one’s own child is still being some­one’s child. Whereas cloning rad­i­cally abol­ishes the Mother, but also the Father, the inter­twin­ing of their genes, the imbri­ca­tion of their dif­fer­ences, but above all the <em>joint</em> act that is pro­cre­ation. The cloner does not beget him­self: he sprouts from each of his seg­ments. One can spec­u­late on the wealth of each of these veg­e­tal branch­ings that in effect resolve all oedi­pal sex­u­al­ity in the ser­vice of “non­hu­man” sex, of sex through imme­di­ate con­ti­gu­ity and reduc­tion—it is still the case that it is no longer a ques­tion of the fan­tasy of auto-gen­e­sis. The Father and the Mother have dis­ap­peared, not in the ser­vice of an aleatory lib­erty of the sub­ject, but in the ser­vice of a <em>matrix called code</em>. No more mother, no more father: a matrix. And it is the matrix, that of the genetic code, that now infin­itely “gives birth” based on a func­tional mode purged of all aleatory sex­u­al­ity.</p>
<p>The sub­ject is also gone, since iden­ti­cal dupli­ca­tion puts an end to his divi­sion. The mirror stage is abol­ished in cloning, or rather it is par­o­died therein in a mon­strous fash­ion. Cloning also retains noth­ing, and for the same reason, of the immemo­rial and nar­cis­sis­tic dream of the sub­ject’s pro­jec­tion into his ideal alter ego, since this pro­jec­tion still passes through an image: the one in the mirror, in which the sub­ject is alien­ated in order to find him­self again, or the one, seduc­tive and mortal, in which the sub­ject sees him­self in order to die there. None of this occurs in cloning. No more medium, no more image—any more than an indus­trial object is the mirror of the iden­ti­cal one that suc­ceeds it in the series. One is never the ideal or mortal mirage of the other, they can only be added to each other, and if they can only be added, it means that they are not sex­u­ally engen­dered and know noth­ing of death.</p>
<p>It is no longer even a ques­tion of being twins, since Gemini or Twins pos­sess a spe­cific prop­erty, a par­tic­u­lar and sacred fas­ci­na­tion of the Two, of what is two together, and never was one. Whereas cloning enshrines the reit­er­a­tion of the same: Ⅰ + Ⅰ + Ⅰ + Ⅰ, etc.</p>
<p>Nei­ther child, nor twin, nor nar­cis­sis­tic reflec­tion, the clone is the mate­ri­al­iza­tion of the double by genetic means, that is to say the abo­li­tion of all alter­ity and of any imag­i­nary. Which is com­bined with the econ­omy of sex­u­al­ity. Deliri­ous apoth­e­o­sis of a pro­duc­tive tech­nol­ogy.</p>
<p>A seg­ment has no need of imag­i­nary medi­a­tion in order to repro­duce itself, any more than the earth­worm needs earth: each seg­ment of the worm is directly repro­duced as a whole worm, just as each cell of the Amer­i­can CEO can pro­duce a new CEO. Just as each frag­ment of a holo­gram can again become the matrix of the com­plete holo­gram: the infor­ma­tion remains whole, with per­haps some­what less def­i­ni­tion, in each of the dis­persed frag­ments of the holo­gram.</p>
<p>This is how one puts an end to total­ity. If all infor­ma­tion can be found in each of its parts, the whole loses its mean­ing. It is also the end of the body, of this sin­gu­lar­ity called body, whose secret is pre­cisely that it cannot be seg­mented into addi­tional cells, that it is an indi­vis­i­ble con­fig­u­ra­tion, to which its sex­u­a­tion is wit­ness (para­dox: cloning will fab­ri­cate sexed beings in per­pe­tu­ity, since they are sim­i­lar to their model, whereas thereby sex becomes use­less—but pre­cisely sex is not a func­tion, it is what makes a body a body, it is what exceeds all the parts, all the diverse func­tions of this body). Sex (or death: in this sense it is the same thing) is what exceeds all infor­ma­tion that can be col­lected on a body. Well, where is all this infor­ma­tion col­lected? In the genetic for­mula. This is why it must nec­es­sar­ily want to forge a path of auton­o­mous repro­duc­tion, inde­pen­dent of sex­u­al­ity and of death.</p>
<p>Already, bio­phys­ioanatom­i­cal sci­ence, by dis­sect­ing the body into organs and func­tions, begins the process of the ana­lytic decom­po­si­tion of the body, and micro­molec­u­lar genet­ics is noth­ing but the log­i­cal con­se­quence, though at a much higher level of abstrac­tion and sim­u­la­tion—at the nuclear level of the com­mand cell, at the direct level of the genetic code, around which this whole phan­tas­mago­ria is orga­nized.</p>
<p>From a func­tional and mech­a­nis­tic point of view, each organ is still only a par­tial and dif­fer­en­ti­ated pros­the­sis: already sim­u­la­tion, but “tra­di­tional.” From the point of view of cyber­net­ics and com­puter sci­ence, it is the small­est undif­fer­en­ti­ated ele­ment, each cell of a body becomes an “embry­onic” pros­the­sis of this body. It is the genetic for­mula inscribed in each cell that becomes the ver­i­ta­ble modern pros­the­sis of all bodies. If the pros­the­sis is com­monly an arti­fact that sup­ple­ments a fail­ing organ, or the instru­men­tal exten­sion of a body, then the DNA mol­e­cule, which con­tains all infor­ma­tion rel­a­tive to a body, is the pros­the­sis par excel­lence, the one that will allow for the <em>indef­i­nite exten­sion of this body by the body itself</em>—this body itself being noth­ing but the indef­i­nite series of its pros­the­ses.</p>
<p>A cyber­netic pros­the­sis infin­itely more subtle and still more arti­fi­cial than any mechan­i­cal pros­the­sis. Because the genetic code is not “nat­u­ral”: just as every abstract and auton­o­mized part of a whole becomes an arti­fi­cial pros­the­sis that alters this whole by sub­sti­tut­ing itself for it (pro-thesis: this is the ety­mo­log­i­cal mean­ing), one can say that the genetic code, where the whole of a being is sup­pos­edly con­densed because all the “infor­ma­tion” of this being would be impris­oned there (there lies the incred­i­ble vio­lence of genetic sim­u­la­tion) is an arti­fact, an oper­a­tional pros­the­sis, an abstract matrix, from which will be able to emerge, no longer even through repro­duc­tion, but through pure and simple renewal, iden­ti­cal beings assigned to the same con­trols.</p>

<p>My genetic pat­ri­mony was fixed once and for all when a cer­tain sper­ma­to­zoa encoun­tered a cer­tain ovum. This her­itage con­tains the recipe for all the bio­chem­i­cal pro­cesses that real­ized me and ensure my func­tion­ing. A copy of this recipe is inscribed in each of the dozens of mil­lions of cells that con­sti­tute me today. Each of these cells knows how to man­u­fac­ture me; before being a cell of my liver or of my blood, it is a cell of me. It is thus the­o­ret­i­cally pos­si­ble to man­u­fac­ture an indi­vid­ual iden­ti­cal to me start­ing with one of these cells. (Pro­fes­sor A. Jacquard)</p>

<p>Cloning is thus the last stage of the his­tory and mod­el­ing of the body, the one at which, reduced to its abstract and genetic for­mula, the indi­vid­ual is des­tined to serial prop­a­ga­tion. It is nec­es­sary to revisit what Walter Ben­jamin said of the work of art in the age of its mechan­i­cal repro­ducibil­ity. What is lost in the work that is seri­ally repro­duced, is its <em>aura</em>, its sin­gu­lar qual­ity of the here and now, its aes­thetic form (it had already lost its ritual form, in its aes­thetic qual­ity), and, accord­ing to Ben­jamin, it takes on, in its ineluctable des­tiny of repro­duc­tion, a <em>polit­i­cal</em> form. What is lost is the orig­i­nal, which only a his­tory itself nos­tal­gic and ret­ro­spec­tive can recon­sti­tute as “authen­tic.” The most advanced, the most modern form of this devel­op­ment, which Ben­jamin described in cinema, pho­tog­ra­phy, and con­tem­po­rary mass media, is one in which the orig­i­nal no longer even exists, since things are con­ceived from the begin­ning as a func­tion of their unlim­ited repro­duc­tion.</p>
<p>This is what hap­pens to us with cloning, no longer only at the level of mes­sages, but at the level of indi­vid­u­als. In fact this is what hap­pens to the body when it ceases to be con­ceived as any­thing but a mes­sage, as a stock­pile of infor­ma­tion and of mes­sages, as fodder for data pro­cess­ing. Thus noth­ing is opposed to the body being seri­ally repro­duced in the same way Ben­jamin describes the repro­duc­tion of indus­trial objects and the images of the mass media. There is a pre­ces­sion of repro­duc­tion over pro­duc­tion, a pre­ces­sion of the genetic model over all pos­si­ble bodies. It is the irrup­tion of tech­nol­ogy that con­trols this rever­sal, of a tech­nol­ogy that Ben­jamin was already describ­ing, in its total con­se­quences, as a total medium, but one still of the indus­trial age—a gigan­tic pros­the­sis that con­trolled the gen­er­a­tion of objects and iden­ti­cal images, in which <em>noth­ing</em> could be dif­fer­en­ti­ated any longer from any­thing else—but still with­out imag­in­ing the cur­rent sophis­ti­ca­tion of this tech­nol­ogy, which ren­ders the gen­er­a­tion of iden­ti­cal <em>beings</em> pos­si­ble, though there is no pos­si­bil­ity of a return to an orig­i­nal being. The pros­the­ses of the indus­trial age are still exter­nal, <em>exotech­ni­cal</em>, those that we know have been sub­di­vided and inter­nal­ized: <em>esotech­ni­cal</em>. We are in the age of soft tech­nolo­gies—genetic and mental soft­ware.</p>
<p>As long as the pros­the­ses of the old indus­trial golden age were mechan­i­cal, they still returned to the body in order to modify its image—con­versely, they them­selves were metab­o­lized in the imag­i­nary and this tech­no­log­i­cal metab­o­lism was also part of the image of the body. But when one reaches a point of no return (dead­end) in sim­u­la­tion, that is to say when the pros­the­sis goes deeper, is inte­ri­or­ized in, infil­trates the anony­mous and micro-molec­u­lar heart of the body, as soon as it is imposed on the body itself as the “orig­i­nal” model, burn­ing all the pre­vi­ous sym­bolic cir­cuits, the only pos­si­ble body the immutable rep­e­ti­tion of the pros­the­sis, then it is the end of the body, of its his­tory, and of its vicis­si­tudes. The indi­vid­ual is no longer any­thing but a can­cer­ous metas­ta­sis of its base for­mula. All the indi­vid­u­als pro­duced through cloning indi­vid­ual X, are they any­thing other than a can­cer­ous metas­ta­sis—the pro­lif­er­a­tion of the same cell such as occurs with cancer? There is a narrow rela­tion between the key con­cept of the genetic code and the pathol­ogy of cancer: the code des­ig­nates the small­est simple ele­ment, the min­i­mal for­mula to which an entire indi­vid­ual can be reduced, and in such a way that he can only repro­duce him­self iden­ti­cally to him­self. Cancer des­ig­nates a pro­lif­er­a­tion ad infini­tum of a base cell with­out taking into con­sid­er­a­tion the organic laws of the whole. It is the same thing with cloning: noth­ing opposes itself any longer to the renewal of the Same, to the unchecked pro­lif­er­a­tion of a single matrix. For­merly, sexed repro­duc­tion still stood in oppo­si­tion to this, today one can finally iso­late the genetic matrix of iden­tity, and one will be able to elim­i­nate all the dif­fer­en­tial vicis­si­tudes that once con­sti­tuted the aleatory charm of indi­vid­u­als.</p>
<p>If all cells are con­ceived pri­mar­ily as a recep­ta­cle of the same genetic for­mula—not only all the iden­ti­cal indi­vid­u­als, but all the cells of the same indi­vid­ual—what are they but the can­cer­ous exten­sion of this base for­mula? The metas­ta­sis that began with indus­trial objects ends with cel­lu­lar orga­ni­za­tion. It is use­less to ask one­self if cancer is an ill­ness of the cap­i­tal­ist age. It is in effect the ill­ness that con­trols all con­tem­po­rary pathol­ogy, because it is the very form of the vir­u­lence of the code: an exac­er­bated redun­dancy of the same sig­nals, an exac­er­bated redun­dancy of the same cells.</p>
<p>The stage of the body changes in the course of an irre­versible tech­no­log­i­cal “pro­gres­sion”: from tan­ning in the sun, which already cor­re­sponds to an arti­fi­cial use of the nat­u­ral medium, that is to say to making it a pros­the­sis of the body (itself becom­ing a sim­u­lated body, but where lies the truth of the body?)—to domes­tic tan­ning with an iodine lamp (yet another good old mechan­i­cal tech­nique)—to tan­ning with pills and hor­mones (chem­i­cal and ingested pros­the­sis)—and finally to tan­ning by inter­ven­ing in the genetic for­mula (an incom­pa­ra­bly more advanced stage, but a pros­the­sis none­the­less, that is, it is simply defini­tively inte­grated, it no longer even passes through either the sur­face or the ori­fices of the body), one passes by dif­fer­ent bodies. It is the schema of the whole that is meta­mor­phosed. The tra­di­tional pros­the­sis, which serves to repair a fail­ing organ, changes noth­ing in the gen­eral model of the body. Organ trans­plants are still of this order. But what should be said of mental mod­el­ing via psy­chotropic agents and drugs? It is the <em>stage of the body</em> that is changed by them. The psy­chotropic body is a body mod­eled “from the inside,” no longer pass­ing through the per­spec­ti­val space of rep­re­sen­ta­tion, of the mirror, and of dis­course. A silent, mental, already molec­u­lar (and no longer spec­u­lar) body, a body metab­o­lized directly, with­out the medi­a­tion of the act or the gaze, an imma­nent body, with­out alter­ity with­out a mise en scène, with­out tran­scen­dence, a body con­se­crated to the implo­sive metab­o­lism of cere­bral, endocrinal flows, a sen­sory, but not sen­si­ble, body because it is con­nected only to its inter­nal ter­mi­nals, and not to objects of per­cep­tion (the reason why one can enclose it in a “white,” blank sen­so­ri­al­ity—dis­con­nect­ing it from its <em>own</em> sen­so­rial extrem­i­ties, with­out touch­ing the world that sur­rounds it, suf­fices), a body already homo­ge­neous, at this stage of plas­tic tac­til­ity, of mental mal­leabil­ity, of psy­chotropism at every level, already close to nuclear and genetic manip­u­la­tion, that is to say to the abso­lute loss of the image, bodies that cannot be rep­re­sented, either to others or to them­selves, bodies enu­cle­ated of their being and of their mean­ing by being trans­fig­ured into a genetic for­mula or through bio­chem­i­cal insta­bil­ity: point of no return, apoth­e­o­sis of a tech­nol­ogy that has itself become inter­sti­tial and molec­u­lar.</p>
<section id="notes" class="level2">
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>One must take into account that can­cer­ous pro­lif­er­a­tion is also a silent dis­obe­di­ence of the injunc­tions of the genetic code. Cancer, if it fits with the logic of a nuclear/com­puter sci­ence vision of human beings, is also its mon­strous excres­cence and nega­tion, because it leads to total dis­in­for­ma­tion and to dis­ag­gre­ga­tion. “Rev­o­lu­tion­ary” pathol­ogy of organic aban­don­ment, Richard Pinhas would say, in <em>Fic­tions</em> (“Notes syn­op­tiques à propos d’un mal mys­térieux” [Syn­op­tic notes on a mys­te­ri­ous ill­ness]). Entropic delir­ium of organ­isms, resist­ing the negen­tropy of infor­ma­tional sys­tems. (It is the same con­junc­tion as that of the masses vis-à-vis struc­tured social for­ma­tions: the masses are also can­cer­ous metas­tases out­side any social organic­ity.)</p>
<p>The same ambi­gu­ity is oper­a­tive in cloning: it is at once the tri­umph of a con­trol­ling hypoth­e­sis, that of the code and of genetic infor­ma­tion, and an eccen­tric dis­tor­tion that destroys its coher­ence. Besides, it is prob­a­ble (but this is left to a future story) that even the “clonic twin” will never be iden­ti­cal to its pro­gen­i­tor, will never be the same, if only because it will have had another before it. It will never be “just like what the genetic code in itself would have changed it to.” Mil­lions of inter­fer­ences will make of it, despite every­thing, a dif­fer­ent being, who will have the very same blue eyes of its father, which is not new. And the cloning exper­i­ment will at least have the advan­tage of demon­strat­ing the rad­i­cal impos­si­bil­ity of mas­ter­ing a process simply by mas­ter­ing infor­ma­tion and the code.<br />

<h1>Holograms</h1>
<div class="initial">
<p>It is the fan­tasy of seiz­ing real­ity live that con­tin­ues—ever since Nar­cis­sus bent over his spring. Sur­pris­ing the real in order to immo­bi­lize it, sus­pend­ing the real in the expi­ra­tion of its double. You bend over the holo­gram like God over his crea­ture: only God has this power of pass­ing through walls, through people, and find­ing Him­self imma­te­ri­ally in the beyond. We dream of pass­ing through our­selves and of find­ing our­selves in the beyond: the day when your holo­graphic double will be there in space, even­tu­ally moving and talk­ing, you will have real­ized this mir­a­cle. Of course, it will no longer be a dream, so its charm will be lost.</p>
</div>
<p>The TV studio trans­forms you into holo­graphic char­ac­ters: one has the impres­sion of being mate­ri­al­ized in space by the light of pro­jec­tors, like translu­cid char­ac­ters who pass through the masses (that of mil­lions of TV view­ers) exactly as your real hand passes through the unreal holo­gram with­out encoun­ter­ing any resis­tance—but not with­out con­se­quences: having passed through the holo­gram has ren­dered your hand unreal as well.</p>
<p>The hal­lu­ci­na­tion is total and truly fas­ci­nat­ing once the holo­gram is pro­jected in front of the plaque, so that noth­ing sep­a­rates you from it (or else the effect remains photo- or cin­e­mato­graphic). This is also char­ac­ter­is­tic of trompe l’oeil, in con­trast to paint­ing: instead of a field as a van­ish­ing point for the eye, you are in a reversed depth, which trans­forms you into a van­ish­ing point … The relief must leap out at you just as a tram car and a chess game would. This said, which type of objects or forms will be “holo­genic” remains to be dis­cov­ered since the holo­gram is no more des­tined to pro­duce three-dimen­sional cinema than cinema was des­tined to repro­duce the­ater, or pho­tog­ra­phy was to take up the con­tents of paint­ing.</p>
<p>In the holo­gram, it is the imag­i­nary aura of the double that is mer­ci­lessly tracked, just as it is in the his­tory of clones. Simil­i­tude is a dream and must remain one, in order for a mod­icum of illu­sion and a stage of the imag­i­nary to exist. One must never pass over to the side of the real, the side of the exact resem­blance of the world to itself, of the sub­ject to itself. Because then the image dis­ap­pears. One must never pass over to the side of the double, because then the dual rela­tion dis­ap­pears, and with it all seduc­tion. Well, with the holo­gram, as with the clone, it is the oppo­site temp­ta­tion, and the oppo­site fas­ci­na­tion, of the end of illu­sion, the stage, the secret through the mate­ri­al­ized pro­jec­tion of all avail­able infor­ma­tion on the sub­ject, through mate­ri­al­ized trans­parency.</p>
<p>After the fan­tasy of seeing one­self (the mirror, the pho­to­graph) comes that of being able to circle around one­self, finally and espe­cially of travers­ing one­self, of pass­ing through one’s own spec­tral body—and any holo­graphed object is ini­tially the lumi­nous ecto­plasm of your own body. But this is in some sense the end of the aes­thetic and the tri­umph of the medium, exactly as in stereo­pho­nia, which, at its most sophis­ti­cated limits, neatly puts an end to the charm and the intel­li­gence of music.</p>
<p>The holo­gram simply does not have the intel­li­gence of trompe l’oeil, which is one of seduc­tion, of always pro­ceed­ing, accord­ing to the rules of appear­ances, through allu­sion to and ellip­sis of pres­ence. It veers, on the con­trary, into fas­ci­na­tion, which is that of pass­ing to the side of the double. If, accord­ing to Mach, the uni­verse is that of which there is no double, no equiv­a­lent in the mirror, then with the holo­gram we are already vir­tu­ally in another uni­verse: which is noth­ing <em>but</em> the mir­rored equiv­a­lent of this one. But which uni­verse is this one?</p>
<p>The holo­gram, the one of which we have always already dreamed (but these are only poor brico­lages of it) gives us the feel­ing, the ver­tigo of pass­ing to the other side of our own body, to the side of the double, lumi­nous clone, or dead twin that is never born in our place, and watches over us by antic­i­pa­tion.</p>
<p>The holo­gram, per­fect image and end of the imag­i­nary. Or rather, it is no longer an image at all—the real medium is the laser, con­cen­trated light, quintessen­tial­ized, which is no longer a vis­i­ble or reflex­ive light, but an abstract light of sim­u­la­tion. Laser/scalpel. A lumi­nous surgery whose func­tion here is that of the double: one oper­ates on you to remove the double as one would oper­ate to remove a tumor. The double that hid in the depths of you (of your body, of your uncon­scious?) and whose secret form fed pre­cisely your imag­i­nary, on the con­di­tion of remain­ing secret, is extracted by laser, is syn­the­sized and mate­ri­al­ized before you, just as it is pos­si­ble for you to pass through and beyond it. A his­tor­i­cal moment: the holo­gram is now part of this “sub­lim­i­nal com­fort” that is our des­tiny, of this hap­pi­ness now con­se­crated to the mental sim­u­lacrum and to the envi­ron­men­tal fable of spe­cial effects. (The social, the social phan­tas­mago­ria, is now noth­ing but a spe­cial effect, obtained by the design of par­tic­i­pat­ing net­works con­verg­ing in empti­ness under the spec­tral image of col­lec­tive hap­pi­ness.)</p>
<p>Three-dimen­sion­al­ity of the sim­u­lacrum—why would the sim­u­lacrum with three dimen­sions be closer to the real than the one with two dimen­sions? It claims to be, but para­dox­i­cally, it has the oppo­site effect: to render us sen­si­tive to the fourth dimen­sion as a hidden truth, a secret dimen­sion of every­thing, which sud­denly takes on all the force of evi­dence. The closer one gets to the per­fec­tion of the sim­u­lacrum (and this is true of objects, but also of fig­ures of art or of models of social or psy­cho­log­i­cal rela­tions), the more evi­dent it becomes (or rather to the evil spirit of incredulity that inhab­its us, more evil still than the evil spirit of sim­u­la­tion) how every­thing escapes rep­re­sen­ta­tion, escapes its own double and its resem­blance. In short, there is no real: the third dimen­sion is only the imag­i­nary of a two-dimen­sional world, the fourth that of a three-dimen­sional uni­verse … Esca­la­tion in the pro­duc­tion of a real that is more and more real through the addi­tion of suc­ces­sive dimen­sions. But, on the other hand, exal­ta­tion of the oppo­site move­ment: only what plays with one less dimen­sion is true, is truly seduc­tive.</p>
<p>In any case, there is no escape from this race to the real and to real­is­tic hal­lu­ci­na­tion since, when an object is exactly like another, <em>it is not exactly like it, it is a bit more exact</em>. There is never simil­i­tude, any more than there is exac­ti­tude. What is exact is already too exact, what is exact is only what approaches the truth with­out trying. It is some­what of the same para­dox­i­cal order as the for­mula that says that as soon as two bil­liard balls roll toward each other, the first touches the other before the second, or, rather, one touches the other before being touched. Which indi­cates that there is not even the pos­si­bil­ity of simul­tane­ity in the order of time, and in the same way no simil­i­tude pos­si­ble in the order of fig­ures. Noth­ing resem­bles itself, and holo­graphic repro­duc­tion, like all fan­tasies of the exact syn­the­sis or res­ur­rec­tion of the real (this also goes for sci­en­tific exper­i­men­ta­tion), is already no longer real, is already <em>hyper­real</em>. It thus never has repro­duc­tive (truth) value, but always already sim­u­la­tion value. Not an exact, but a trans­gres­sive truth, that is to say already on the other side of the truth. What hap­pens on the other side of the truth, not in what would be false, but in what is more true than the true, more real than the real? Bizarre effects cer­tainly, and sac­ri­leges, much more destruc­tive of the order of truth than its pure nega­tion. Sin­gu­lar and mur­der­ous power of the poten­tial­iza­tion of the truth, of the poten­tial­iza­tion of the real. This is per­haps why twins were dei­fied, and sac­ri­ficed, in a more savage cul­ture: hyper­simil­i­tude was equiv­a­lent to the murder of the orig­i­nal, and thus to a pure non-mean­ing. Any clas­si­fi­ca­tion or sig­ni­fi­ca­tion, any modal­ity of mean­ing can thus be destroyed simply by log­i­cally being ele­vated to the nth power—pushed to its limit, it is as if all truth swal­lowed its own cri­te­ria of truth as one “swal­lows one’s birth cer­tifi­cate” and lost all its mean­ing. Thus the weight of the world, or the uni­verse, can even­tu­ally be cal­cu­lated in exact terms, but ini­tially it appears absurd, because it no longer has a ref­er­ence, or a mirror in which it can come to be reflected—this total­iza­tion, which is prac­ti­cally equiv­a­lent to that of all the dimen­sions of the real in its hyper­real double, or to that of all the infor­ma­tion on an indi­vid­ual in his genetic double (clone), ren­ders it imme­di­ately pat­a­phys­i­cal. The uni­verse itself, taken glob­ally, is what cannot be rep­re­sented, what does not have a pos­si­ble com­ple­ment in the mirror, what has no equiv­a­lence in mean­ing (it is as absurd to give it a mean­ing, a weight of mean­ing, as to give it weight at all). Mean­ing, truth, the real cannot appear except locally, in a restricted hori­zon, they are par­tial objects, par­tial effects of the mirror and of equiv­a­lence. All dou­bling, all gen­er­al­iza­tion, all pas­sage to the limit, all holo­graphic exten­sion (the fancy of exhaus­tively taking account of this uni­verse) makes them sur­face in their mock­ery.</p>
<p>Viewed at this angle, even the exact sci­ences come dan­ger­ously close to pat­a­physics. Because they depend in some way on the holo­gram and on the objec­tivist whim of the decon­struc­tion and exact recon­struc­tion of the world (in its small­est terms) founded on a tena­cious and naive faith in a pact of the simil­i­tude of things to them­selves. The real, the real object is sup­posed to be equal to itself, it is sup­posed to resem­ble itself like a face in a mirror—and this vir­tual simil­i­tude is in effect the only def­i­ni­tion of the real—and any attempt, includ­ing the holo­graphic one, that rests on it, will inevitably miss its object, because it does not take its <em>shadow</em> into account (pre­cisely the reason why it does not resem­ble itself)—this hidden face where the object crum­bles, its secret. The holo­graphic attempt lit­er­ally jumps over its shadow, and plunges into trans­parency, to lose itself there.</p>

<h1><em>Crash</em></h1>
<div class="initial">
<p>From a clas­si­cal (even cyber­netic) per­spec­tive, tech­nol­ogy is an exten­sion of the body. It is the func­tional sophis­ti­ca­tion of a human organ­ism that per­mits it to be equal to nature and to invest tri­umphally in nature. From Marx to McLuhan, the same func­tion­al­ist vision of machines and lan­guage: they are relays, exten­sions, media medi­a­tors of nature ide­ally des­tined to become the organic body of man. In this “ratio­nal” per­spec­tive the body itself is noth­ing but a medium.</p>

Each of them would join his own imag­i­na­tion, the tender mem­branes of his mucous sur­faces, his grooves of erec­tile tissue, to the wounds of this minor actress through the medium of his own motor­car, touch­ing them as he drove in a medley of styl­ized pos­tures. Each would place his lips on those bleed­ing aper­tures, lay his own nasal septum against the lesions of her left hand, press his eye­lids against the exposed tendon of her fore­fin­ger, the dorsal sur­face of his erect penis against the rup­tured lat­eral walls of her vagina. The auto­mo­bile crash had made pos­si­ble the final and longed-for union of the actress and the mem­bers of her audi­ence.</em> (Pp. 189-90)</p>
<p>Tech­nol­ogy is never grasped except in the (auto­mo­bile) acci­dent, that is to say in the vio­lence done to tech­nol­ogy itself and in the vio­lence done to the body. It is the same: any shock, any blow, any impact, all the met­al­lurgy of the acci­dent can be read in the semi­urgy of the body—nei­ther an anatomy nor a phys­i­ol­ogy, but a semi­urgy of con­tu­sions, scars, muti­la­tions, wounds that are so many new sexual organs opened on the body. In this way, gath­er­ing the body as labor in the order of pro­duc­tion is opposed to the dis­per­sion of the body as ana­gram in the order of muti­la­tion. Good­bye “eroge­nous zones”: every­thing becomes a hole to offer itself to the dis­charge reflex. But above all (as in prim­i­tive ini­ti­a­tion tor­tures, which are not ours), the whole body becomes a sign to offer itself to the exchange of bodily signs. Body and tech­nol­ogy diffract­ing their bewil­dered signs through each other. Carnal abstrac­tion and design.</p>
<p>No affect behind all that, no psy­chol­ogy, no flux or desire, no libido or death drive. Nat­u­rally, death is impli­cated in an unlim­ited explo­ration of the pos­si­ble vio­lence done to the body, but this is never, as in sadism or masochism, with an express and per­verse aim of vio­lence, a dis­tor­tion of mean­ing and of sex (in rela­tion to what?). No repressed uncon­scious (affects or rep­re­sen­ta­tions), except in a second read­ing that would still rein­ject a forced mean­ing, based on the psy­cho­an­a­lytic model. The non-mean­ing, the sav­agery, of this mix­ture of the body and of tech­nol­ogy is imma­nent, it is the imme­di­ate rever­sion of one to the other, and from this results a sex­u­al­ity with­out prece­dent—a sort of poten­tial ver­tigo linked to the pure inscrip­tion of the empty signs of this body. Sym­bolic ritual of inci­sion and marks, like the graf­fiti on New York sub­ways.</p>
<p>Another point in common: it is no longer a ques­tion, in <em>Crash</em>, of acci­den­tal signs that would only appear at the mar­gins of the system. The Acci­dent is no longer this inter­sti­tial brico­lage that it still is in the high­way acci­dent—the resid­ual brico­lage of the death drive for the new leisure classes. The car is not the appen­dix of a domes­tic, immo­bile uni­verse, there is no longer a pri­vate and domes­tic uni­verse, there are only inces­sant fig­ures of cir­cu­la­tion, and the Acci­dent is every­where, the ele­men­tary, irre­versible figure, the banal­ity of the anom­aly of death. It is no longer at the margin, it is at the heart. It is no longer the excep­tion to a tri­umphal ratio­nal­ity, it has become the Rule, it has devoured the Rule. It is no longer even the “accursed share,” the one con­ceded to des­tiny by the system itself, and included in its gen­eral reck­on­ing. Every­thing is reversed. It is the Acci­dent that gives form to life, it is the Acci­dent, the insane, that is <em>the sex of life</em>. And the auto­mo­bile, the mag­netic sphere of the auto­mo­bile, which ends by invest­ing the entire uni­verse with its tun­nels, high­ways, tobog­gans, exchang­ers, its mobile dwelling as uni­ver­sal pro­to­type, is noth­ing but the immense metaphor of life.</p>
<p>Dys­func­tion is no longer pos­si­ble in a uni­verse of the acci­dent—there­fore no per­ver­sion is either. The Acci­dent, like death, is no longer of the order of the neu­rotic, the repressed, the resid­ual or the trans­gres­sive, it is the insti­ga­tor of a new mode of <em>non­per­verse</em> plea­sure (con­trary to the author him­self, who speaks in the intro­duc­tion of a new per­verse logic, one must resist the moral temp­ta­tion of read­ing <em>Crash</em> as per­ver­sion), of a strate­gic orga­ni­za­tion of life that starts from death. Death, wounds, muti­la­tions are no longer metaphors of cas­tra­tion, exactly the oppo­site—not even the oppo­site. Only the fetishis­tic metaphor is per­verse, seduc­tion via the model, via the inter­posed fetish, or via the medium of lan­guage. Here, death and sex are read on the same level as the body, with­out phan­tasms, with­out metaphor, with­out sen­tences—dif­fer­ent from the Machine of <em>The Penal Colony</em>, where the body in its wounds is still only the sup­port of a tex­tual inscrip­tion. Thus one, Kafka’s machine, is still puri­tan, repres­sive, “a sig­ni­fy­ing machine” Deleuze would say, whereas the tech­nol­ogy in <em>Crash</em> is shin­ing, seduc­tive, or dull and inno­cent. Seduc­tive because denuded of mean­ing, and because it is the simple mirror of torn-up bodies. And Vaughan’s body is in its turn the mirror of bent chrome, of crum­pled fend­ers, of sheet iron stained with sperm. Bodies and tech­nol­ogy com­bined, seduced, inex­tri­ca­ble.</p>
<p><em>As Vaughan turned the car into a fill­ing sta­tion court­yard the scar­let light from the neon sign over the por­tico flared across these grainy pho­to­graphs of appalling injuries: the breasts of teenage girls deformed by instru­ment bin­na­cles, the par­tial mamo­plas­ties … nip­ples sec­tioned by man­u­fac­tur­ers’ dash­board medal­lions; injuries to male and female gen­i­talia caused by steer­ing wheel shrouds, wind­shields during ejec­tion … A suc­ces­sion of pho­to­graphs of muti­lated penises, sec­tioned vulvas and crushed tes­ti­cles passed through the flar­ing light as Vaughan stood by the girl fill­ing-sta­tion atten­dant at the rear of the car, joc­u­larly talk­ing to her about her body. In sev­eral of the pho­to­graphs the source of the wound was indi­cated by a detail of that por­tion of the car which had caused the injury: beside a casu­alty ward pho­to­graph of a bifur­cated penis was an inset of a hand­brake unit; above a close-up of a mas­sively bruised vulva was a steer­ing-wheel boss and its man­u­fac­turer’s medal­lion. These unions of torn gen­i­talia and sec­tions of car body and instru­ment panel formed a series of dis­turb­ing mod­ules, units in a new cur­rency of pain and desire.</em> (P. 134)</p>
<p>Each mark, each trace, each scar left on the body is like an arti­fi­cial invagi­na­tion, like the scar­i­fi­ca­tions of sav­ages, which are always a vehe­ment response to the absence of the body. Only the wounded body exists sym­bol­i­cally—for itself and for others—“sexual desire” is never any­thing but the pos­si­bil­ity bodies have of com­bin­ing and exchang­ing their signs. Now, the few nat­u­ral ori­fices to which one usu­ally attaches sex and sexual activ­i­ties are noth­ing next to all the pos­si­ble wounds, all the arti­fi­cial ori­fices (but why “arti­fi­cial”?), all the breaches through which the body is reversibi­lized and, like cer­tain topo­log­i­cal spaces, no longer knows either inte­rior nor exte­rior. Sex as we know it is noth­ing but a minute and spe­cial­ized def­i­ni­tion of all the sym­bolic and sac­ri­fi­cial prac­tices to which a body can open itself, no longer though nature, but through arti­fice, through the sim­u­lacrum, through the acci­dent. Sex is noth­ing but this rar­efac­tion of a drive called desire on pre­vi­ously pre­pared zones. It is largely over­taken by the fan of sym­bolic wounds, which is in some sense the ana­gramma­ti­za­tion of sex on the whole length of the body—but now pre­cisely, it is no longer sex, it is some­thing else, sex, itself, is noth­ing but the inscrip­tion of a priv­i­leged sig­ni­fier and some sec­ondary marks noth­ing next to the exchange of all the signs and wounds of which the body is capa­ble. The sav­ages knew how to use the whole body to this end, in tat­too­ing, tor­ture, ini­ti­a­tion sex­u­al­ity was only one of the pos­si­ble metaphors of sym­bolic exchange, nei­ther the most sig­nif­i­cant, nor the most pres­ti­gious, as it has become for us in its obses­sional and real­is­tic ref­er­ence, thanks to its organic and func­tional char­ac­ter (includ­ing in orgasm).</p>
<p><em>As the car trav­elled for the first time at twenty miles an hour Vaughan drew his fin­gers from the girl’s vulva and anus, rotated his hips and inserted his penis in her vagina. Head­lamps flared above us as the stream of cars moved up the slope of the over­pass. In the rear-view mirror I could still see Vaughan and the girl, their bodies lit by the car behind, reflected in the black trunk of the Lin­coln and a hun­dred points of the inte­rior trim. In the chromium ash­tray I saw the girl’s left breast and erect nipple. In the vinyl window gutter I saw deformed sec­tions of Vaughan’s thighs and her abdomen form­ing a bizarre anatom­i­cal junc­tion. Vaughan lifted the young woman astride him, his penis enter­ing her vagina again. In a trip­tych of images reflected in the speedome­ter, the clock and rev­o­lu­tion counter, the sexual act between Vaughan and this young woman took place in the hooded grot­toes of these lumi­nes­cent dials, mod­er­ated by the surg­ing needle of the speedome­ter. The jut­ting cara­pace of the instru­ment panel and the styl­ized sculp­ture of the steer­ing column shroud reflected a dozen images of her rising and fall­ing but­tocks. As I pro­pelled the car at fifty miles an hour along the open deck of the over­pass Vaughan arched his back and lifted the young woman into the full glare of the head­lamps behind us. Her sharp breasts flashed within the chromium and glass cage of the speed­ing car. Vaughan’s strong pelvic spasms coin­cided with the thud­ding pas­sage of the lamp stan­dards anchored in the over­pass at hun­dred-yard inter­vals. As each one approached his hips kicked into the girl, driv­ing his penis into her vagina, his hands splay­ing her but­tocks to reveal her anus as the yellow light filled the car.</em> (P. 143)</p>
<p>Here, all the erotic terms are tech­ni­cal. No ass, no dick, no cunt but: the anus, the rectum, the vulva, the penis, coitus. No slang, that is to say no inti­macy of sexual vio­lence, but a func­tional lan­guage: the ade­qua­tion of chrome and mucous as of one form to another. The same goes for the cor­re­spon­dence of death and sex: it is more as if they are cov­ered together in a sort of tech­ni­cal superde­sign than artic­u­lated accord­ing to plea­sure. Besides, it is not a ques­tion of orgasm, but of pure and simple dis­charge. And the coitus and sperm that tra­verse the book have no more sen­sual value than the fil­i­gree of wounds has vio­lent mean­ing, even metaphor­i­cally speak­ing. They are noth­ing but sig­na­tures—in the final scene, X imprints the car wrecks with his sperm.</p>
<p>Plea­sure (whether per­verse or not) was always medi­ated by a tech­ni­cal appa­ra­tus, by a mech­a­nism of real objects but more often of phan­tasms—it always implies an inter­me­di­ary manip­u­la­tion of scenes or gad­gets. Here, plea­sure is only orgasm, that is to say, con­fused on the same wave length with the vio­lence of the tech­ni­cal appa­ra­tus, and homog­e­nized by the only tech­nique, one summed up by a single object: the auto­mo­bile.</p>
<p><em>We had entered an immense traf­fic jam. From the junc­tion of the motor­way and West­ern Avenue to the ascent ramp of the fly­over the traf­fic lanes were packed with vehi­cles, wind­shields bleach­ing out the molten colours of the sun set­ting above the west­ern sub­urbs of London. Brake-lights flared in the evening air, glow­ing in the huge pool of cel­lu­losed bodies. Vaughan sat with one arm out of the pas­sen­ger window. He slapped the door impa­tiently, pound­ing the panel with his fist. To our right the high wall of a double-decker air­line coach formed a cliff of faces. The pas­sen­gers at the win­dows resem­bled rows of the dead look­ing down at us from the gal­leries of a colum­bar­ium. The enor­mous energy of the twen­ti­eth cen­tury, enough to drive the planet into a new orbit around a hap­pier star, was being expended to main­tain this immense motion­less pause.</em> (P. 151)</p>
<p><em>Around me, down the entire length of West­ern Avenue, along both ramps of the fly­over, stretched an immense con­ges­tion of traf­fic held up by the acci­dent. Stand­ing at the centre of this paral­ysed hur­ri­cane, I felt com­pletely at ease, as if my obses­sions with the end­lessly mul­ti­ply­ing vehi­cles had at last been relieved.</em> (P. 156)</p>
<p>Yet in <em>Crash</em>, another dimen­sion is insep­a­ra­ble from the con­fused ones of tech­nol­ogy and of sex (united in a work of death that is never a work of mourn­ing): it is that of the pho­to­graph and of cinema. The shin­ing and sat­u­rated sur­face of traf­fic and of the acci­dent is with­out depth, but it is always dou­bled in Vaughan’s camera lens. The lens stock­piles and hoards acci­dent photos like dossiers. The gen­eral rep­e­ti­tion of the cru­cial event that it foments (his auto­mo­bile death and the simul­ta­ne­ous death of the star in a col­li­sion with Eliz­a­beth Taylor, a crash metic­u­lously sim­u­lated and refined over a period of months) occurs out­side a cin­e­mato­graphic take. This uni­verse would be noth­ing with­out this hyper­real dis­con­nec­tion. Only the dou­bling, the unfold­ing of the visual medium in the second degree can pro­duce the fusion of tech­nol­ogy, sex, and death. But in fact, the pho­to­graph here is not a medium nor is it of the order of rep­re­sen­ta­tion. It is not a ques­tion of a “sup­ple­men­tary” abstrac­tion of the image, nor of a spec­tac­u­lar com­pul­sion, and Vaughan’s posi­tion is never that of the voyeur or the per­vert. The pho­to­graphic film (like tran­sis­tor­ized music in auto­mo­biles and apart­ments) is part of the uni­ver­sal, hyper­real, met­al­lized, and cor­po­real layer of traf­fic and flows. The photo is no more of a medium than tech­nol­ogy or the body—all are simul­ta­ne­ous in a uni­verse where the antic­i­pa­tion of the event coin­cides with its repro­duc­tion, indeed with its “real” pro­duc­tion. No more tem­po­ral depth either—just like the past, the future ceases to exist in turn. In fact, it is the eye of the camera that is sub­sti­tuted for time, just as it is for any other depth, that of affect, space, lan­guage. It is not another dimen­sion, it simply sign­fies that this uni­verse is with­out secrets.</p>
<p><em>The man­nequin rider sat well back, the onrush­ing air lift­ing his chin. His hands were shack­led to the han­dle­bars like a kamikaze pilot’s. His long thorax was plas­tered with meter­ing devices. In front of him, their expres­sions equally vacant, the family of four man­nequins sat in their vehi­cle. Their faces were marked with cryp­tic sym­bols.</em></p>
<p><em>A harsh whip­ping noise came toward us, the sound of the meter­ing coils skat­ing along the grass beside the rail. There was a vio­lent metal­lic explo­sion as the motor­cy­cle struck the front of the saloon car. The two vehi­cles veered side­ways towards the line of star­tled spec­ta­tors. I regained my bal­ance, invol­un­tar­ily hold­ing Vaughan’s shoul­der, as the motor­cy­cle and its driver sailed over the bonnet of the car and struck the wind­shield, then careened across the roof in a black mass of frag­ments. The car plunged ten feet back on its hawsers. It came to rest astride the rails. The bonnet, wind­shield and roof had been crushed by the impact. Inside the cabin, the lop­sided family lurched across each other, the decap­i­tated torso of the front-seat woman pas­sen­ger embed­ded in the frac­tured wind­shield … Shav­ings of fibre­glass from its face and shoul­ders speck­led the glass around the test car like silver snow, a death con­fetti. Helen Rem­ing­ton held my arm. She smiled at me, nod­ding encour­ag­ingly as if urging a child across some mental hurdle. “We can have a look at it again on the Ampex. They’re show­ing it in slow-motion.”</em> (Pp. 124—25)</p>
<p>In <em>Crash</em>, every­thing is hyper­func­tional, since traf­fic and acci­dent, tech­nol­ogy and death, sex and sim­u­la­tion are like a single, large syn­chro­nous machine. It is the same uni­verse as that of the hyper­mar­ket, where the com­mod­ity becomes “hyper­com­mod­ity,” that is to say itself always already cap­tured, and the whole atmos­phere with it, in the inces­sant fig­ures of traf­fic. But at the same time, the func­tion­al­ism of <em>Crash</em> devours its own ratio­nal­ity, because it does not know dys­func­tion. It is a rad­i­cal func­tion­al­ism that reaches its para­dox­i­cal limits and burns them. At once it again becomes an inde­fin­able, there­fore fas­ci­nat­ing, object. Nei­ther good nor bad: ambiva­lent. Like death or fash­ion, it becomes all of a sudden an <em>object at the cross­roads</em>, whereas good old func­tion­al­ism, even con­tested, no longer is at all—that is to say, it becomes a path lead­ing more quickly than the main road, or lead­ing where the main road does not lead or, better yet, and to parody Littré in a pat­a­phys­i­cal mode, “a path lead­ing nowhere, but lead­ing there faster than the others.”</p>
<p>This is what dis­tin­guishes <em>Crash</em> from all sci­ence fic­tion or almost all, which most of the time still revolves around the old couple func­tion/dys­func­tion, which it projects in the future along the same lines of force and the same final­i­ties that are those of the normal uni­verse. There fic­tion sur­passes real­ity (or the oppo­site), but accord­ing to the same rules of the game. In <em>Crash</em>, no more fic­tion or real­ity, it is hyper­re­al­ity that abol­ishes both. Not even a crit­i­cal regres­sion is pos­si­ble. This mutat­ing and com­mu­tat­ing world of sim­u­la­tion and death, this vio­lently sexed world, but one with­out desire, full of vio­lated and vio­lent bodies, as if neu­tral­ized, this chro­matic world and metal­lic inten­sity, but one void of sen­su­al­ity, hyper­tech­nol­ogy with­out final­ity—is it good or bad? We will never know. It is simply fas­ci­nat­ing, though this fas­ci­na­tion does not imply a value judg­ment. There lies the mir­a­cle of <em>Crash</em>. Nowhere does this moral gaze sur­face—the crit­i­cal judg­ment that is still part of the func­tion­al­ity of the old world. <em>Crash</em> is hyper­crit­i­cism (there also in con­trast to its author who, in the intro­duc­tion, speaks of the “warn­ing against that brutal, erotic, and over­lit realm that beck­ons more and more per­sua­sively to us from the mar­gins of the tech­no­log­i­cal land­scape”<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>). Few books, few films reach this res­o­lu­tion of all final­ity or crit­i­cal neg­a­tiv­ity, this dull splen­dor of banal­ity or of vio­lence. <em>Nash­ville, Clock­work Orange</em>.</p>
<p>After Borges, but in another reg­is­ter, <em>Crash</em> is the first great novel of the uni­verse of sim­u­la­tion, the one with which we will all now be con­cerned—a sym­bolic uni­verse, but one which, through a sort of rever­sal of the mass-medi­ated sub­stance (neon, con­crete, car, erotic machin­ery), appears as if tra­versed by an intense force of ini­ti­a­tion.</p>
<p><em>The last of the ambu­lances drove away, its siren wail­ing. The spec­ta­tors returned to their cars, or climbed the embank­ment to the break in the wire fence. An ado­les­cent girl in a denim suit walked past us, her young man with an arm around her waist. He held her right breast with the back of his hand, stroking her nipple with his knuck­les. They stepped into a beach buggy slashed with pen­nants and yellow paint and drove off, horn hoot­ing eccen­tri­cally. A burly man in a truck-driver’s jacket helped his wife up the embank­ment, a hand on her but­tocks. This per­va­sive sex­u­al­ity filled the air, as if we were mem­bers of a con­gre­ga­tion leav­ing after a sermon urging us to cel­e­brate our sex­u­al­i­ties with friends and strangers, and were driv­ing into the night to imi­tate the bloody eucharist we had observed with the most unlikely part­ners.</em> (P. 157)</p>

<section id="simulacra-and-science-fiction" class="level1">
<h1>Simulacra and Science Fiction</h1>
<div class="initial-up">
<p>Three orders of sim­u­lacra:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>simulacra that are natural, naturalist, founded on the image, on imitation and counterfeit, that are harmonious, optimistic, and that aim for the restitution or the ideal institution of nature made in God’s image;</li>
<li>simulacra that are productive, productivist, founded on energy, force, its materialization by the machine and in the whole system of production—a Promethean aim of a continuous globalization and expansion, of an indefinite liberation of energy (desire belongs to the utopias related to this order of simulacra);</li>
<li>simulacra of simulation, founded on information, the model, the cybernetic game—total operationality, hyperreality, aim of total control.</li>
</ul>
<p>To the first cat­e­gory belongs the imag­i­nary of the <em>utopia</em>. To the second cor­re­sponds sci­ence fic­tion, strictly speak­ing. To the third cor­re­sponds—is there an imag­i­nary that might cor­re­spond to this order? The most likely answer is that the good old imag­i­nary of sci­ence fic­tion is dead and that some­thing else is in the process of emerg­ing (not only in fic­tion but in theory as well). The same waver­ing and inde­ter­mi­nate fate puts an end to sci­ence fic­tion—but also to theory, as spe­cific genres.</p>
<p>There is no real, there is no imag­i­nary except at a cer­tain dis­tance. What hap­pens when this dis­tance, includ­ing that between the real and the imag­i­nary, tends to abol­ish itself, to be reab­sorbed on behalf of the model? Well, from one order of sim­u­lacra to another, the ten­dency is cer­tainly toward the reab­sorp­tion of this dis­tance, of this gap that leaves room for an ideal or crit­i­cal pro­jec­tion.</p>
<ul>
<li>This projection is maximized in the utopian, in which a transcendent sphere, a radically different universe takes form (the romantic dream is still the individualized form of utopia, in which transcendence is outlined in depth, even in unconscious structures, but in any case the dissociation from the real world is maximized, the island of utopia stands opposed to the continent of the real).</li>
<li>This projection is greatly reduced in science fiction: it is most often nothing other than an unbounded projection of the real world of production, but it is not qualitatively different from it. Mechanical or energetic extensions, speed, and power increase to the nth power, but the schemas and the scenarios are those of mechanics, metallurgy, etc. Projected hypostasis of the robot. (To the limited universe of the preindustrial era, utopia <em>opposed</em> an ideal, alternative universe. To the potentially infinite universe of production, science fiction <em>adds</em> the multiplication of its own possibilities.)</li>
<li>This projection is totally reabsorbed in the implosive era of models. The models no longer constitute either transcendence or projection, they no longer constitute the imaginary in relation to the real, they are themselves an anticipation of the real, and thus leave no room for any sort of fictional anticipation—they are immanent, and thus leave no room for any kind of imaginary transcendence. The field opened is that of simulation in the cybernetic sense, that is, of the manipulation of these models at every level (scenarios, the setting up of simulated situations, etc.) but then <em>nothing distinguishes this operation from the operation itself and the gestation of the real: there is no more fiction</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Real­ity could go beyond fic­tion: that was the surest sign of the pos­si­bil­ity of an ever-increas­ing imag­i­nary. But the real cannot sur­pass the model—it is noth­ing but its alibi.</p>
<p>The imag­i­nary was the alibi of the real, in a world dom­i­nated by the real­ity prin­ci­ple. Today, it is the real that has become the alibi of the model, in a world con­trolled by the prin­ci­ple of sim­u­la­tion. And, para­dox­i­cally, it is the real that has become our true utopia—but a utopia that is no longer in the realm of the pos­si­ble, that can only be dreamt of as one would dream of a lost object.</p>
<p>Per­haps sci­ence fic­tion from the cyber­netic and hyper­real era can only exhaust itself, in its arti­fi­cial res­ur­rec­tion of “his­tor­i­cal” worlds, can only try to recon­struct in vitro, down to the small­est details, the perime­ters of a prior world, the events, the people, the ide­olo­gies of the past, emp­tied of mean­ing, of their orig­i­nal process, but hal­lu­ci­na­tory with ret­ro­spec­tive truth. Thus in <em>Sim­u­lacra</em> by Philip K. Dick, the war of Seces­sion. Gigan­tic holo­gram in three dimen­sions, in which fic­tion will never again be a mirror held toward the future, but a des­per­ate rehal­lu­ci­na­tion of the past.</p>
<p>We can no longer imag­ine any other uni­verse: the grace of tran­scen­dence was taken away from us in that respect too. Clas­si­cal sci­ence fic­tion was that of an expand­ing uni­verse, besides, it forged its path in the nar­ra­tives of spa­tial explo­ration, coun­ter­parts to the more ter­res­trial forms of explo­ration and col­o­niza­tion of the nine­teenth and twen­ti­eth cen­turies. There is no rela­tion­ship of cause and effect there: it is not because ter­res­trial space today is vir­tu­ally coded, mapped, reg­is­tered, sat­u­rated, has thus in a sense closed up again in uni­ver­sal­iz­ing itself—a uni­ver­sal market, not only of mer­chan­dise, but of values, signs, models, leav­ing no room for the imag­i­nary—it is not exactly because of this that the exploratory uni­verse (tech­ni­cal, mental, cosmic) of sci­ence fic­tion has also ceased to func­tion. But the two are nar­rowly linked, and they are two ver­sions of the same gen­eral process of implo­sion that fol­lows the gigan­tic process of explo­sion and expan­sion char­ac­ter­is­tic of past cen­turies. When a system reaches its own limits and becomes sat­u­rated, a rever­sal is pro­duced—some­thing else takes place, in the imag­i­nary as well.</p>
<p>Until now we have always had a reserve of the imag­i­nary—now the coef­fi­cient of real­ity is pro­por­tional to the reserve of the imag­i­nary that gives it its spe­cific weight. This is also true of geo­graphic and spa­tial explo­ration: when there is no longer any virgin ter­ri­tory, and thus one avail­able to the imag­i­nary, <em>when the map covers the whole ter­ri­tory, some­thing like the prin­ci­ple of real­ity dis­ap­pears</em>. In this way, the con­quest of space con­sti­tutes an irre­versible cross­ing toward the loss of the ter­res­trial ref­er­en­tial. There is a hem­or­rhag­ing of real­ity as an inter­nal coher­ence of a lim­ited uni­verse, once the limits of this uni­verse recede into infin­ity. The con­quest of space that fol­lows that of the planet is equal to dere­al­iz­ing (dema­te­ri­al­iz­ing) human space, or to trans­fer­ring it into a hyper­real of sim­u­la­tion. Wit­ness this two-bed­room/kitchen/shower put into orbit, raised to a spa­tial power (one could say) with the most recent lunar module. The every­day­ness of the ter­res­trial habi­tat itself ele­vated to the rank of cosmic value, hypo­sta­tized in space—the satel­liza­tion of the real in the tran­scen­dence of space—it is the end of meta­physics, the end of the phan­tasm, the end of sci­ence fic­tion—the era of hyper­re­al­ity begins.</p>
<p>From then onward, some­thing must change: the pro­jec­tion, the extrap­o­la­tion, the sort of pan­to­graphic excess that con­sti­tuted the charm of sci­ence fic­tion are all impos­si­ble. It is no longer pos­si­ble to fab­ri­cate the unreal from the real, the imag­i­nary from the givens of the real. The process will, rather, be the oppo­site: it will be to put decen­tered sit­u­a­tions, models of sim­u­la­tion in place and to con­trive to give them the feel­ing of the real, of the banal, of lived expe­ri­ence, to rein­vent the real as fic­tion, pre­cisely because it has dis­ap­peared from our life. Hal­lu­ci­na­tion of the real, of lived expe­ri­ence, of the quo­tid­ian, but recon­sti­tuted, some­times down to dis­qui­et­ingly strange details, recon­sti­tuted as an animal or veg­e­tal reserve, brought to light with a trans­par­ent pre­ci­sion, but with­out sub­stance, dere­al­ized in advance, hyper­re­al­ized.</p>
<p>In this way, sci­ence fic­tion would no longer be a roman­tic expan­sion with all the free­dom and naivete that the charm of dis­cov­ery gave it, but, quite the con­trary, it would evolve implo­sively in the very image of our cur­rent con­cep­tion of the uni­verse, attempt­ing to revi­tal­ize, reac­tu­al­ize, requo­tid­i­an­ize frag­ments of sim­u­la­tion, frag­ments of this uni­ver­sal sim­u­la­tion that have become for us the so-called real world.</p>
<p>Where would the works be that would meet, here and now, this sit­u­a­tional inver­sion, this sit­u­a­tional rever­sion? Obvi­ously the short sto­ries of Philip K. Dick “grav­i­tate” in this space, if one can use that word (but that is pre­cisely what one can’t really do any more, because this new uni­verse is “anti­grav­i­ta­tional,” or if it still grav­i­tates, it is around the <em>hole</em> of the real, around the <em>hole</em> of the imag­i­nary). One does not see an alter­na­tive cosmos, a cosmic folk­lore or exoti­cism, or a galac­tic prow­ess there—one is from the start in a total sim­u­la­tion, with­out origin, imma­nent, with­out a past, with­out a future, a dif­fu­sion of all coor­di­nates (mental, tem­po­ral, spa­tial, sig­naletic)—it is not about a par­al­lel uni­verse, a double uni­verse, or even a pos­si­ble uni­verse—nei­ther pos­si­ble, impos­si­ble, nei­ther real nor unreal: <em>hyper­real</em>—it is a uni­verse of sim­u­la­tion, which is some­thing else alto­gether. And not because Dick speaks specif­i­cally of sim­u­lacra sci­ence fic­tion has always done so, but it played on the double, on dou­bling or redou­bling, either arti­fi­cial or imag­i­nary, whereas here the double has dis­ap­peared, there is no longer a double, one is always already in the other world, which is no longer an other, with­out a mirror, a pro­jec­tion, or a utopia that can reflect it—sim­u­la­tion is insu­per­a­ble, unsur­pass­able, dull and flat, with­out exte­ri­or­ity—we will no longer even pass through to “the other side of mirror,” that was still the golden age of tran­scen­dence.</p>
<p>Per­haps a still more con­vinc­ing exam­ple would be that of Bal­lard and of his evo­lu­tion from the first very “phan­tas­magoric” short sto­ries, poetic, dream­like, dis­ori­ent­ing, up to <em>Crash</em>, which is with­out a doubt (more than <em>IGH</em> or <em>Con­crete Island</em>) the cur­rent model of this sci­ence fic­tion that is no longer one. <em>Crash</em> is <em>our</em> world, noth­ing in it is “invented”: every­thing in it is hyper-func­tional, both the cir­cu­la­tion and the acci­dent, tech­nique and death, sex and pho­to­graphic lens, every­thing in it is like a giant, syn­chro­nous, sim­u­lated machine: that is to say the accel­er­a­tion of our own models, of all models that sur­round us, blended and hyper­op­er­a­tional in the void. This is what dis­tin­guishes <em>Crash</em> from almost all sci­ence fic­tion, which mostly still revolves around the old (mechan­i­cal and mech­a­nis­tic) couple func­tion/ dys­func­tion, which it projects into the future along the same lines of force and the same final­i­ties that are those of the “normal” uni­verse. Fic­tion in that uni­verse might sur­pass real­ity (or the oppo­site: that is more subtle) but it still plays by the same rules. In <em>Crash</em>, there is nei­ther fic­tion nor real­ity any­more—hyper­re­al­ity abol­ishes both. It is there that our con­tem­po­rary sci­ence fic­tion, if there is one, exists. <em>Jack Barron or Eter­nity</em>, some pas­sages from <em>Every­one to Zanz­ibar</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, sci­ence fic­tion in this sense is no longer any­where, and it is every­where, in the cir­cu­la­tion of models, here and now, in the very prin­ci­ple of the sur­round­ing sim­u­la­tion. It can emerge in its crude state, from the iner­tia itself of the oper­a­tional world. What writer of sci­ence fic­tion would have “imag­ined” (but pre­cisely it can no longer be “imag­ined”) this “real­ity” of East German fac­to­ries-sim­u­lacra, fac­to­ries that reem­ploy all the unem­ployed to fill all the roles and all the posts of the tra­di­tional pro­duc­tion process but that don’t pro­duce any­thing, whose activ­ity is con­sumed in a game of orders, of com­pe­ti­tion, of writ­ing, of book­keep­ing, between one fac­tory and another, inside a vast net­work? All mate­rial pro­duc­tion is redou­bled in the void (one of these sim­u­lacra fac­to­ries even “really” failed, putting its own unem­ployed out of work a second time). That is sim­u­la­tion: not that the fac­to­ries are fake, but pre­cisely that they are real, hyper­real, and that because of this they return all “real” pro­duc­tion, that of “seri­ous” fac­to­ries, to the same hyper­re­al­ity. What is fas­ci­nat­ing here is not the oppo­si­tion between real fac­to­ries and fake fac­to­ries, but on the con­trary the lack of dis­tinc­tion between the two, the fact that all the rest of pro­duc­tion has no greater ref­er­ent or deeper final­ity than this “sim­u­lacra!” busi­ness. It is this hyper­real indif­fer­ence that con­sti­tutes the real “sci­ence-fic­tional” qual­ity of this episode. And one can see that it is not nec­es­sary to invent it: it is there, emerg­ing from a world with­out secrets, with­out depth.</p>
<p>With­out a doubt, the most dif­fi­cult thing today, in the com­plex uni­verse of sci­ence fic­tion, is to unravel what still com­plies (and a large part still does) with the imag­i­nary of the second order, of the pro­duc­tive/pro­jec­tive order, and what already comes from this vague­ness of the imag­i­nary, of this uncer­tainty proper to the third order of sim­u­la­tion. Thus one can clearly mark the dif­fer­ence between the mechan­i­cal robot machines, char­ac­ter­is­tic of the second order, and the cyber­netic machines, com­put­ers, etc., that, in their gov­ern­ing prin­ci­ple, depend on the third order. But one order can cer­tainly con­tam­i­nate another, and the com­puter can cer­tainly func­tion as a mechan­i­cal super­ma­chine, a super­robot, a super­power machine, expos­ing the pro­duc­tive genie of the sim­u­lacra of the second order: the com­puter does not come into play as a process of sim­u­la­tion, and it still bears wit­ness to the reflexes of a final­ized uni­verse (includ­ing ambiva­lence and revolt, like the com­puter from <em>2001</em> or Shal­manezer in <em>Every­one to Zanz­ibar</em>).</p>
<p>Between the <em>oper­atic</em> (the the­atri­cal status of the­atri­cal and fan­tas­ti­cal machin­ery, the “grand opera” of tech­nique) that cor­re­sponds to the first order, the <em>oper­a­tive</em> (the indus­trial, pro­duc­tive status, pro­duc­tive of power and energy) that cor­re­sponds to the second order, and the <em>oper­a­tional</em> (the cyber­netic, aleatory, uncer­tain status of “metat­e­ch­nique”) that cor­re­sponds to the third order, all inter­fer­ence can still be pro­duced today at the level of sci­ence fic­tion. But only the last order can still truly inter­est us.</p>

<h1>The Animals: Territory and Metamorphoses</h1>
<div class="initial">
<p>What did the tor­tur­ers of the Inqui­si­tion want? The admis­sion of evil, of the prin­ci­ple of evil. It was nec­es­sary to make the accused say that he was not guilty except by acci­dent, through the inci­dence of the prin­ci­ple of Evil in the divine order. Thus con­fes­sion restored a reas­sur­ing causal­ity, and tor­ture, and the exter­mi­na­tion of evil through tor­ture, were noth­ing but the tri­umphal coro­na­tion (nei­ther sadis­tic nor expi­a­tory) of the fact of having <em>pro­duced Evil as cause</em>. Oth­er­wise, the least heresy would have ren­dered all of divine cre­ation sus­pect. In the same way, when we use and abuse ani­mals in lab­o­ra­to­ries, in rock­ets, with exper­i­men­tal feroc­ity in the name of sci­ence, what con­fes­sion are we seek­ing to extort from them from beneath the scalpel and the elec­trodes?</p>
</div>
<p>Pre­cisely the admis­sion of a prin­ci­ple of objec­tiv­ity of which sci­ence is never cer­tain, of which it secretly despairs. Ani­mals must be made to say that they are not ani­mals, that bes­tial­ity, sav­agery—with what these terms imply of unin­tel­li­gi­bil­ity, rad­i­cal strange­ness to reason—do not exist, but on the con­trary the most bes­tial behav­iors, the most sin­gu­lar, the most abnor­mal are resolved in sci­ence, in phys­i­o­log­i­cal mech­a­nisms, in cere­bral con­nec­tions, etc. Bes­tial­ity, and its prin­ci­ple of uncer­tainty, must be killed in ani­mals.</p>
<p>Exper­i­men­ta­tion is thus not a means to an end, it is a <em>con­tem­po­rary</em> chal­lenge and tor­ture. It does not found an intel­li­gi­bil­ity, it extorts a con­fes­sion from sci­ence as pre­vi­ously one extorted a pro­fes­sion of faith. A con­fes­sion whose appar­ent dis­tances—ill­ness, mad­ness, bes­tial­ity—are noth­ing but a pro­vi­sional crack in the trans­parency of causal­ity. This proof, as before that of divine reason, must be con­tin­u­ally redone and every­where redone—in this sense we are all ani­mals, and lab­o­ra­tory ani­mals, whom one con­tin­u­ally tests in order to extort their reflex behav­iors, which are like so many con­fes­sions of ratio­nal­ity in the final moment. Every­where bes­tial­ity must yield to reflex ani­mal­ity, exor­cis­ing an order of the inde­ci­pher­able, of the savage, of which, pre­cisely in their silence, ani­mals have remained the incar­na­tion for us.</p>
<p>Ani­mals have thus pre­ceded us on the path of lib­eral exter­mi­na­tion. All the aspects of the modern treat­ment of ani­mals retrace the vicis­si­tudes of the manip­u­la­tion of humans, from exper­i­men­ta­tion to indus­trial pres­sure in breed­ing.</p>

<p>Rab­bits develop a morbid anx­i­ety, they become coprophagous and ster­ile. The rabbit is “anx­ious,” “mal­adapted” from birth, so it seems. Greater sen­si­tiv­ity to infec­tions, to par­a­sites. The anti­bod­ies lose their effi­cacy, the females become ster­ile. Spon­ta­neously, if one can say so, mor­tal­ity increases.</p>
<p>The hys­te­ria of chick­ens infects the whole group, a “psy­chic” col­lec­tive ten­sion that can reach a crit­i­cal thresh­old: all the ani­mals begin to fly and scream in all direc­tions. The crisis over, there is a col­lapse, gen­eral terror, the ani­mals take refuge in the corner, mute and as if par­a­lyzed. At the first shock, the crisis begins again. It can last sev­eral weeks. One attempted to give them tran­quil­iz­ers …</p>
<p>Can­ni­bal­ism on the part of pigs. The ani­mals wound them­selves. The calves begin to lick every­thing that sur­rounds them, some­times even unto death.</p>
<p>“It is cer­tainly nec­es­sary to estab­lish that bred ani­mals suffer <em>psy­chi­cally</em>… A zoo psy­chi­a­try becomes nec­es­sary… A psy­chic life of frus­tra­tion rep­re­sents an obsta­cle to normal devel­op­ment.”</p>
<p>Dark­ness, red light, gad­gets, tran­quil­iz­ers, noth­ing works. In birds there is a hier­ar­chy of access to food—the <em>peck­ing order</em>. In these con­di­tions of over­pop­u­la­tion, the last in the order is never able to get to the food. One thus wished to break the <em>peck­ing order</em> and <em>democ­ra­tize</em> access to food through another system of dis­tri­bu­tion. Fail­ure: the destruc­tion of this sym­bolic order brings along with it total con­fu­sion for the birds, and a chronic insta­bil­ity. Good exam­ple of absur­dity: one knows the anal­o­gous rav­ages of good demo­cratic inten­tions in tribal soci­eties.</p>
<p>Ani­mals som­a­tize! Extra­or­di­nary dis­cov­ery! Can­cers, gas­tric ulcers, myocar­dial infarc­tion in mice, pigs, chick­ens!</p>
<p>In con­clu­sion, the author says, it cer­tainly seems that the only remedy is space—“a bit more space, and a lot of the prob­lems observed would dis­ap­pear.” In any case, “the fate of these ani­mals would become less mis­er­able.” He is thus sat­is­fied with this con­fer­ence: “The cur­rent con­cern about the fate of bred ani­mals is wit­ness, <em>once again</em>, to the alliance of the moral­ity and the mean­ing of a well—under­stood inter­est.” “One cannot simply do what­ever one wants with nature.” The prob­lems having become seri­ous enough to damage the prof­itabil­ity of busi­ness, this drop in prof­itabil­ity may lead the breed­ers to return the ani­mals to more normal living con­di­tions. “In order to be raised in a healthy manner, it is now nec­es­sary to be always con­cerned with the <em>mental equi­lib­rium of the ani­mals</em>.” And he fore­sees the time when one will send ani­mals, like people, to the coun­try, to restore their mental equi­lib­rium.</p>
<p>One has never said better how much “human­ism,” “nor­mal­ity,” “qual­ity of life” were noth­ing but the vicis­si­tudes of prof­itabil­ity. The par­al­lel between these ani­mals sick from sur­plus value and humans sick from indus­trial con­cen­tra­tion, from the sci­en­tific orga­ni­za­tion of work and assem­bly—line fac­to­ries is illu­mi­nat­ing. In the latter case as well, the cap­i­tal­ist “breed­ers” were led to a revi­sion that was destruc­tive of the mode of exploita­tion, inno­vat­ing and rein­vent­ing the “qual­ity of work,” the “enrich­ment of tasks,” dis­cov­er­ing the “human” sci­ences and the “psycho-soci­o­log­i­cal” dimen­sion of the fac­tory. Only the inevitabil­ity of death ren­ders the exam­ple of the ani­mals more shock­ing still than that of men on an assem­bly line.</p>
<p>Against the indus­trial orga­ni­za­tion of death, ani­mals have no other recourse, no other pos­si­ble defi­ance, except sui­cide. All the anom­alies described are sui­ci­dal. These resis­tances are a fail­ure of indus­trial reason (drop in prof­its), but also one senses that they run counter to the <em>log­i­cal</em> rea­son­ing of the spe­cial­ists. In the logic of reflex behav­iors and of the animal—machine, in ratio­nal logic, these anom­alies are not qual­i­fi­able. One will there­fore bestow on ani­mals a psy­chic life, an irra­tional and derailed psy­chic life, given over to lib­eral and human­ist ther­apy, with­out the final objec­tive ever having changed: death.</p>
<p>With inge­nu­ity, one thus dis­cov­ers, like a new and unex­plored <em>sci­en­tific</em> field, the psy­chic life of the animal as soon as he is revealed to be mal­adapted to the death one is pre­par­ing for him. In the same way one redis­cov­ers psy­chol­ogy, soci­ol­ogy, the sex­u­al­ity of pris­on­ers as soon as it becomes impos­si­ble to purely and simply incar­cer­ate them.<a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> One dis­cov­ers that the pris­oner needs lib­erty, sex­u­al­ity, “nor­malcy” to with­stand prison, just as indus­tri­ally bred ani­mals need a cer­tain “qual­ity of life” to die within the norm. And noth­ing about this is con­tra­dic­tory. The worker also needs respon­si­bil­ity, self­man­age­ment in order to better respond to the imper­a­tive of pro­duc­tion. Every­one needs a psy­chic life to adapt. There is no other reason for the arrival of the psy­chic life, con­scious or uncon­scious. And its golden age, which still con­tin­ues, will have coin­cided with the impos­si­bil­ity of a ratio­nal social­iza­tion in every domain. Never would the human­i­ties or psy­cho­anal­y­sis have existed if it had been mirac­u­lously pos­si­ble to reduce man to his “ratio­nal” behav­iors. The whole dis­cov­ery of the psy­cho­log­i­cal, whose com­plex­ity can extend ad infini­tum, comes from noth­ing but the impos­si­bil­ity of exploit­ing to death (the work­ers), of incar­cer­at­ing to death (the detained), of fat­ten­ing to death (the ani­mals), accord­ing to the strict law of equiv­a­lences:</p>
<ul>
<li>so much caloric energy and time = so much work power</li>
<li>such an infraction = such an equivalent punishment</li>
<li>so much food = optimal weight and industrial death.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every­thing is blocked, so psy­chic life, the mental, neu­ro­sis, the psy­choso­cial, etc. are born, not at all in order to break this deliri­ous equa­tion, but to restore the prin­ci­ple of mutu­ally agreed upon equiv­a­lences.</p>
<p>Beasts of burden, they had to work for man. Beasts of demand, they are sum­moned to respond to the inter­ro­ga­tion of sci­ence.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Beasts of con­sump­tion, they have become the meat of indus­try. Beasts of som­a­ti­za­tion, they are now made to speak the “psy” lan­guage, to answer for their psy­chic life and the mis­deeds of their uncon­scious. Every­thing has hap­pened to them that has hap­pened to us. Our des­tiny has never been sep­a­rated from theirs, and this is a sort of bitter revenge on Human Reason, which has become used to uphold­ing the abso­lute priv­i­lege of the Human over the Bes­tial.</p>
<p>Besides, ani­mals were only demoted to the status of inhu­man­ity as reason and human­ism pro­gressed. A logic par­al­lel to that of racism. An objec­tive animal “reign” has only existed since Man has existed. It would take too long to redo the geneal­ogy of their respec­tive sta­tuses, but the abyss that sep­a­rates them today, the one that per­mits us to send beasts, in our place, to respond to the ter­ri­fy­ing uni­verses of space and lab­o­ra­to­ries, the one that per­mits the liq­ui­da­tion of species even as they are archived as spec­i­mens in the African reserves or in the hell of zoos—since there is no more room for them in our cul­ture than there is for the dead—the whole cov­ered by a racist sen­ti­men­tal­ity (baby seals, Brigitte Bardot), this abyss that sep­a­rates them fol­lows domes­ti­ca­tion, just as true racism fol­lows slav­ery.</p>
<p>Once ani­mals had a more sacred, more divine char­ac­ter than men. There is not even a reign of the “human” in prim­i­tive soci­eties, and for a long time the animal order has been the order of ref­er­ence. Only the animal is worth being sac­ri­ficed, as a god, the sac­ri­fice of man only comes after­ward, accord­ing to a degraded order. Men qual­ify only by their affil­i­a­tion to the animal: the Boro­ros “are” macaws. This is not of the pre­l­og­i­cal or psy­cho­an­a­lytic order—nor of the mental order of clas­si­fi­ca­tion, to which Lévi-Strauss reduced the animal effigy (even if it is still fab­u­lous that ani­mals served as a <em>lan­guage</em>, this was also part of their divin­ity)-no, this sig­ni­fies that Boro­ros and macaws are part of a cycle, and that the figure of the cycle excludes any divi­sion of species, any of the dis­tinc­tive oppo­si­tions upon which we live. The struc­tural oppo­si­tion is <em>dia­bolic</em>, it divides and con­fronts dis­tinct iden­ti­ties: such is the divi­sion of the Human, which throws beasts into the Inhu­man—the cycle, itself, is sym­bolic: it abol­ishes the posi­tions in a reversible enchain­ment—in this sense, the Boro­ros “are” macaws, in the same way that the Canaque say the dead walk among the living. (Does Deleuze envi­sion some­thing like that in his becom­ing-animal and when he says “Be the rose pan­ther!”?)</p>
<p>What­ever it may be, ani­mals have always had, until our era, a divine or sac­ri­fi­cial nobil­ity that all mytholo­gies recount. Even murder by hunt­ing is still a sym­bolic rela­tion, as opposed to an exper­i­men­tal dis­sec­tion. Even domes­ti­ca­tion is still a sym­bolic rela­tion, as opposed to indus­trial breed­ing. One only has to look at the status of ani­mals in peas­ant soci­ety. And the status of domes­ti­ca­tion, which pre­sup­poses land, a clan, a system of parent­age of which the ani­mals are a part, must not be con­fused with the status of the domes­tic pet—the only type of ani­mals that are left to us out­side reserves and breed­ing sta­tions—dogs, cats, birds, ham­sters, all packed together in the affec­tion of their master. The tra­jec­tory ani­mals have fol­lowed, from divine sac­ri­fice to dog ceme­ter­ies with atmo­spheric music, from sacred defi­ance to eco­log­i­cal sen­ti­men­tal­ity, speaks loudly enough of the vul­gar­iza­tion of the status of man him­self—it once again describes an unex­pected rec­i­proc­ity between the two.</p>
<p>In par­tic­u­lar, our sen­ti­men­tal­ity toward ani­mals is a sure sign of the dis­dain in which we hold them. It is pro­por­tional to this dis­dain. It is in pro­por­tion to being rel­e­gated to irre­spon­si­bil­ity, to the inhu­man, that the animal becomes worthy of the human ritual of affec­tion and pro­tec­tion, just as the child does in direct pro­por­tion to being rel­e­gated to a status of inno­cence and child­ish­ness. Sen­ti­men­tal­ity is noth­ing but the infin­itely degraded form of bes­tial­ity, the racist com­mis­er­a­tion, in which we ridicu­lously cloak ani­mals to the point of ren­der­ing them sen­ti­men­tal them­selves. Those who used to sac­ri­fice ani­mals did not take them for beasts. And even the Middle Ages, which con­demned and pun­ished them in due form, was in this way much closer to them than we are, we who are filled with horror at this prac­tice. They held them to be guilty: which was a way of hon­or­ing them. We take them for noth­ing, and it is on this basis that we are “human” with them. We no longer sac­ri­fice them, we no longer punish them, and we are proud of it, but it is simply that we have domes­ti­cated them, worse: that we have made of them a racially infe­rior world, no longer even worthy of our jus­tice, but only of our affec­tion and social char­ity, no longer worthy of pun­ish­ment and of death, but only of exper­i­men­ta­tion and exter­mi­na­tion like meat from the butch­ery.</p>
<p>It is the reab­sorp­tion of all vio­lence in regard to them that today forms the mon­stros­ity of beasts. The vio­lence of sac­ri­fice, which is one of “inti­macy” (Bataille), has been suc­ceeded by the sen­ti­men­tal or exper­i­men­tal vio­lence that is one of dis­tance.</p>
<p>Mon­stros­ity has changed in mean­ing. The orig­i­nal mon­stros­ity of the beast, object of terror and fas­ci­na­tion, but never neg­a­tive, always ambiva­lent, object of exchange also and of metaphor, in sac­ri­fice, in mythol­ogy, in the heraldic bes­tiary, and even in our dreams and our phan­tasms—this mon­stros­ity, rich in every threat and every meta­mor­pho­sis, one that is secretly resolved in the living cul­ture of men, and that is a form of alliance, has been exchanged for a spec­tac­u­lar mon­stros­ity: that of King Kong wrenched from his jungle and trans­formed into a music-hall star. For­merly, the cul­tural hero anni­hi­lated the beast, the dragon, the mon­ster—and from the spilt blood plants, men, cul­ture were born; today, it is the beast King Kong who comes to sack our indus­trial metrop­o­lises, who comes to lib­er­ate us from our cul­ture, a cul­ture dead from having purged itself of all real mon­stros­ity and from having broken its pact with it (which was expressed in the film by the prim­i­tive gift of the woman). The pro­found seduc­tion of the film comes from this inver­sion of mean­ing: all inhu­man­ity has gone over to the side of men, all human­ity has gone over to the side of cap­tive bes­tial­ity, and to the respec­tive seduc­tion of man and of beast, mon­strous seduc­tion of one order by the other, the human and the bes­tial. Kong dies for having renewed, through seduc­tion, this pos­si­bil­ity of the meta­mor­pho­sis of one reign into another, this inces­tu­ous promis­cu­ity between beasts and men (though one that is never real­ized, except in a sym­bolic and ritual mode).</p>
<p>In the end, the pro­gres­sion that the beast fol­lowed is not dif­fer­ent form that of mad­ness and child­hood, of sex or negri­tude. A logic of exclu­sion, of reclu­sion, of dis­crim­i­na­tion and nec­es­sar­ily, in return, a logic of rever­sion, reversible vio­lence that makes it so that all of soci­ety finally aligns itself on the axioms of mad­ness, of child­hood, of sex­u­al­ity, and of infe­rior races (purged, it must be said, of the rad­i­cal inter­ro­ga­tion to which, from the very heart of their exclu­sion, they lent impor­tance). The con­ver­gence of pro­cesses of civ­i­liza­tion is astound­ing. Ani­mals, like the dead, and so many others, have fol­lowed this unin­ter­rupted process of annex­a­tion through exter­mi­na­tion, which con­sists of liq­ui­da­tion, then of making the extinct species speak, of making them present the con­fes­sion of their dis­ap­pear­ance. Making ani­mals speak, as one has made the insane, chil­dren, sex (Fou­cault) speak. This is even deluded in regard to ani­mals, whose prin­ci­ple of uncer­tainty, which they have caused to weigh on men since the rup­ture in their alliance with men, resides in the fact that <em>they do not speak</em>.</p>
<p><em>The chal­lenge of mad­ness has his­tor­i­cally been met by the hypoth­e­sis of the uncon­scious.</em> The Uncon­scious is this logis­ti­cal mech­a­nism that per­mits us to think mad­ness (and more gen­er­ally all strange and anoma­lous for­ma­tions) in a system of mean­ing opened to non­mean­ing, which will make room for the ter­rors of the non­sen­si­cal, now intel­li­gi­ble under the aus­pices of a cer­tain dis­course: psy­chic life, drive, repres­sion, etc. The mad were the ones who forced us to the hypoth­e­sis of the uncon­scious, but we are the ones in return who have trapped them there. Because if, ini­tially, the Uncon­scious seems to turn against Reason and to bring to it a rad­i­cal sub­ver­sion, if it still seems charged with the poten­tial of the rup­ture of mad­ness, later it turns against mad­ness, because it is what enables mad­ness to be annexed to a reason more uni­ver­sal than clas­si­cal reason.</p>
<p>The mad, once mute, today are heard by every­one; one has found the grid on which to col­lect their once absurd and inde­ci­pher­able mes­sages. Chil­dren speak, to the adult uni­verse they are no longer those simul­ta­ne­ously strange and insignif­i­cant beings chil­dren sig­nify, they have become sig­nif­i­cant—not through some sort of “lib­er­a­tion” of their speech, but because adult reason has given itself the most subtle means to avert the threat of their silence. The prim­i­tives also are heard, one seeks them out, one lis­tens to them, they are no longer beasts. Lévi-Strauss pointed out that their mental struc­tures were the same as ours, psy­cho­anal­y­sis ral­lied them to Oedi­pus, and to the libido—all of our codes func­tioned well, and they responded to them. One had buried them under silence, one buries them beneath speech, “dif­fer­ent” speech cer­tainly, but beneath the word of the day, “dif­fer­ence,” as for­merly one did beneath the unity of Reason; let us not be misled by this, it is the same order that is advanc­ing. The impe­ri­al­ism of reason, neoim­pe­ri­al­ism of dif­fer­ence.</p>
<p>What is essen­tial is that noth­ing escape the empire of mean­ing, the shar­ing of mean­ing. Cer­tainly, behind all that, noth­ing speaks to us, nei­ther the mad, nor the dead, nor chil­dren, nor sav­ages, and fun­da­men­tally we know noth­ing of them, but what is essen­tial is that Reason save face, and that every­thing escape silence.</p>
<p>They, the ani­mals, do not speak. In a uni­verse of increas­ing speech, of the con­straint to con­fess and to speak, only they remain mute, and for this reason they seem to retreat far from us, behind the hori­zon of truth. But it is what makes us inti­mate with them. It is not the eco­log­i­cal prob­lem of their sur­vival that is impor­tant, but still and always that of their silence. In a world bent on doing noth­ing but making one speak, in a world assem­bled under the hege­mony of signs and dis­course, their silence weighs more and more heav­ily on our orga­ni­za­tion of mean­ing.</p>
<p>Cer­tainly, one makes them speak, and with all means, some more inno­cent than others. They spoke the moral dis­course of man in fables. They sup­ported struc­tural dis­course in the theory of totemism. Every day they deliver their “objec­tive”—anatom­i­cal, phys­i­o­log­i­cal, genetic—mes­sage in lab­o­ra­to­ries. They served in turns as metaphors for virtue and vice, as an ener­getic and eco­log­i­cal model, as a mechan­i­cal and formal model in bion­ics, as a phan­tas­matic reg­is­ter for the uncon­scious and, lastly, as a model for the abso­lute deter­ri­to­ri­al­iza­tion of desire in Deleuze’s “becom­ing-animal” (para­dox­i­cal: to take the animal as a model of deter­ri­to­ri­al­iza­tion when he is the ter­ri­to­rial being par excel­lence).</p>
<p>In all this—metaphor, guinea pig, model, alle­gory (with­out for­get­ting their ali­men­tary “use value”)—ani­mals main­tain a com­pul­sory dis­course. Nowhere do they really speak, because they only fur­nish the responses one asks for. It is their way of send­ing the Human back to his cir­cu­lar codes, behind which their silence ana­lyzes us.</p>
<p>One never escapes the rever­sion that fol­lows any kind of exclu­sion. Refus­ing reason to madmen leads sooner or later to dis­man­tling the bases of this reason—the mad take revenge in some way. Refus­ing ani­mals the uncon­scious, repres­sion, the sym­bolic (con­fused with lan­guage) is, one can hope, sooner or later (in a sort of dis­con­nec­tion sub­se­quent to that of mad­ness and of the uncon­scious) to put in ques­tion once again the valid­ity of these con­cepts, just as they govern and dis­tin­guish us today. Because, if for­merly the priv­i­lege of Man was founded on the monop­oly of con­scious­ness, today it is founded on the monop­oly of the uncon­scious.</p>
<p>Ani­mals have no uncon­scious, this is well known. With­out a doubt, they dream, but this is a con­jec­ture of a bio­elec­tri­cal order, and they lack lan­guage, which alone gives mean­ing to the dream by inscrib­ing it in the sym­bolic order. We can fan­ta­size about them, project our fan­tasies on them and think we are shar­ing this mise-en-scène. But this is com­fort­able for us—in fact ani­mals are not intel­li­gi­ble to us either under the regime of con­scious­ness or under that of the uncon­scious. There­fore, it is not a ques­tion of forc­ing them to it, but just the oppo­site of seeing <em>in what way they put in ques­tion this very hypoth­e­sis of the uncon­scious, and to what other hypoth­e­sis they force us</em>. Such is the mean­ing, or the non-mean­ing of their silence.</p>
<p>Such was the silence of madmen that it forced us to the hypoth­e­sis of the uncon­scious such is the resis­tance of ani­mals that it forces us to change hypothe­ses. For if to us they are and will remain unin­tel­li­gi­ble, yet we live in some kind of under­stand­ing with them. And if we live in this way, under the sign of a gen­eral ecol­ogy where in a sort of plan­e­tary niche, which is only the enlarged dimen­sion of the Pla­tonic cave, the ghosts of ani­mals and the nat­u­ral ele­ments would come to rub against the shadow of men who sur­vived the polit­i­cal econ­omy—no, our pro­found under­stand­ing with beasts, even on the road to dis­ap­pear­ance, is placed under the con­ju­gated sign, oppo­site in appear­ance, of <em>meta­mor­pho­sis and of ter­ri­tory</em>.</p>
<p>Noth­ing seems more fixed in the per­pet­u­a­tion of the species than ani­mals, but yet they are for us the image of meta­mor­pho­sis, of all pos­si­ble meta­mor­phoses. Noth­ing more errant, more nomadic in appear­ance than ani­mals, and yet their law is that of the ter­ri­tory.<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> But one must push aside all the coun­ter­mean­ings on this notion of ter­ri­tory. It is not at all the enlarged rela­tion of a sub­ject or of a group to its own space, a sort of organic right to pri­vate prop­erty of the indi­vid­ual, of the clan or of the species—such is the phan­tasm of psy­chol­ogy and of soci­ol­ogy extended to all of ecol­ogy—nor this sort of vital func­tion, of an envi­ron­men­tal bubble where the whole system of needs is summed up.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> A ter­ri­tory is also not a space, with what this term implies for us about lib­erty and appro­pri­a­tion. Nei­ther instinct, nor need, nor struc­ture (be it “cul­tural” and “behav­ioral”), the notion of ter­ri­tory is also opposed in some way to that of the uncon­scious. The uncon­scious is a “buried,” repressed, and indef­i­nitely sub­di­vided struc­ture. The ter­ri­tory is open and cir­cum­scribed. The uncon­scious is the site of the indef­i­nite rep­e­ti­tion of sub­jec­tive repres­sion and fan­tasies. The ter­ri­tory is the site of a com­pleted cycle of parent­age and exchanges—with­out a sub­ject, but with­out excep­tion: animal and veg­e­tal cycle, cycle of goods and wealth, cycle of parent­age and the species, cycle of women and ritual—there is no sub­ject and every­thing is exchanged. The obli­ga­tions are abso­lute therein—total reversibil­ity—but no one knows death there, since all is meta­mor­phosed. Nei­ther sub­ject, nor death, nor uncon­scious, nor repres­sion, since noth­ing stops the enchain­ment of forms.</p>
<p>Ani­mals have no uncon­scious, because they have a ter­ri­tory. Men have only had an uncon­scious since they lost a ter­ri­tory. At once ter­ri­to­ries and meta­mor­phoses have been taken from them—the uncon­scious is the indi­vid­ual struc­ture of mourn­ing in which this loss is inces­santly, hope­lessly replayed—ani­mals are the nos­tal­gia for it. The ques­tion that they raise for us would thus be this one: don’t we live now and already, beyond the effects of the lin­ear­ity and the accu­mu­la­tion of reason, beyond the effects of the con­scious and uncon­scious, accord­ing to this brute, sym­bolic mode, of indef­i­nite cycling and rever­sion over a finite space? And beyond the ideal schema that is that of our cul­ture, of all cul­ture maybe, of the accu­mu­la­tion of energy, and of the final lib­er­a­tion, don’t we dream of implo­sion rather than of explo­sion, of meta­mor­pho­sis rather than energy, of obli­ga­tion and ritual defi­ance rather than of lib­erty, of the ter­ri­to­rial cycle rather than of … But the ani­mals do not ask ques­tions. They are silent.</p>

<section id="the-remainder" class="level1">
<h1>The Remainder</h1>
<div class="initial">
<p><em>When every­thing is taken away, noth­ing is left.</em><br />
This is false.<br />
The equa­tion of every­thing and noth­ing, the sub­trac­tion of the remain­der, is totally false.</p>
</div>
<p>It is not that there is no remain­der. But this remain­der never has an auton­o­mous real­ity, nor its own place: it is what par­ti­tion, cir­cum­scrip­tion, exclu­sion des­ig­nate… what else? It is through the sub­trac­tion of the remain­der that real­ity is founded and gath­ers strength… what else?</p>
<p>What is strange is pre­cisely that there is no oppos­ing term in a binary oppo­si­tion: one can say the right/the left, the same/the other, the major­ity/the minor­ity, the crazy/the normal, etc.—but the remain­der/<span class="nothing"></span> ? Noth­ing on the other side of the slash. “The sum and the remain­der,” the addi­tion and the remain­der, the oper­a­tion and the remain­der are not dis­tinc­tive oppo­si­tions.</p>
<p>And yet, what is on the other side of the remain­der exists, it is even the marked term, the pow­er­ful moment, the priv­i­leged ele­ment in this strangely asym­met­ri­cal oppo­si­tion, in this struc­ture that is not one. But this marked term has no name. It is anony­mous, it is unsta­ble and with­out def­i­ni­tion. Pos­i­tive, but only the neg­a­tive gives it the force of real­ity. In a strict sense, it cannot be defined except as the remain­der of the remain­der.</p>
<p>Thus the remain­der refers to much more than a clear divi­sion in two local­ized terms, to a turn­ing and reversible struc­ture, an always immi­nent struc­ture of rever­sion, in which <em>one never knows which is the remain­der of the other</em>. In no other struc­ture can one create this rever­sion, or this mise-en-abyme: the mas­cu­line is not the fem­i­nine of the fem­i­nine, the normal is not the crazy of the crazy, the right is not the left of the left, etc. Per­haps only in the mirror can the ques­tion be posed: which, the real or the image, is the reflec­tion of the other? In this sense one can speak of the remain­der as a mirror, or of the mirror of the remain­der. It is that in both cases the line of struc­tural demar­ca­tion, the line of the shar­ing of mean­ing, has become a waver­ing one, it is that mean­ing (most lit­er­ally: the pos­si­bil­ity of going from one point to another accord­ing to a vector deter­mined by the respec­tive posi­tion of the terms) no longer exists. There is no longer a respec­tive posi­tion—the real dis­ap­pear­ing to make room for an image, more real than the real, and con­versely—the remain­der dis­ap­pear­ing from the assigned loca­tion to resur­face inside out, in what it was the remain­der of, etc.</p>
<p>The same is true of the social. Who can say if the remain­der of the social is the residue of the nonso­cial­ized, or if it is not the social itself that is the remain­der, the gigan­tic waste prod­uct… of what else? Of a process, which even if it were to com­pletely dis­ap­pear and had no name except the social would nev­er­the­less only be its remain­der. The residue can be com­pletely at the level of the real. When a system has absorbed every­thing, when one has added every­thing up, when noth­ing remains, <em>the entire sum turns to the remain­der</em> and becomes the remain­der.</p>
<p>Wit­ness the “Soci­ety” column of <em>Le Monde</em>, in which para­dox­i­cally, only immi­grants, delin­quents, women, etc. appear—every­thing that has not been social­ized, “social” cases anal­o­gous to patho­log­i­cal cases. Pock­ets to be reab­sorbed, seg­ments that the “social” iso­lates as it grows. Des­ig­nated as “resid­ual” at the hori­zon of the social, they enter its juris­dic­tion in this way and are des­tined to find their place in an enlarged social­ity. It is for this remain­der that the social machine is recharged and finds new energy. But what hap­pens when every­thing is sponged up, when every­thing is social­ized? Then the machine stops, the dynamic is reversed, and it is the whole social system that becomes residue. As the social in its pro­gres­sion elim­i­nates all the residue, it itself becomes resid­ual. In des­ig­nat­ing resid­ual cat­e­gories as “Soci­ety,” <em>the social des­ig­nates itself as a remain­der</em>.</p>
<p>The impos­si­bil­ity of deter­min­ing what is the remain­der of the other char­ac­ter­izes the phase of sim­u­la­tion and the death throes of dis­tinc­tive sys­tems, a phase when every­thing becomes a remain­der and a resid­ual. Inversely, the dis­ap­pear­ance of the fatidic and struc­tural slash that iso­lated the rest of ? ? ? and that now per­mits each term to be the remain­der of the other term char­ac­ter­izes a phase of reversibil­ity during which there is “vir­tu­ally” <em>no more remain­der</em>. The two propo­si­tions are simul­ta­ne­ously “true” and are not mutu­ally exclu­sive. They are them­selves reversible.</p>
<p>Another aspect as sur­pris­ing as the absence of an oppos­ing term: the remain­der makes you laugh. Any dis­cus­sion on this theme unleashes the same lan­guage games, the same ambi­gu­ity, and the same obscen­ity as do dis­cus­sions of sex or death. Sex and death are the great themes rec­og­nized for unleash­ing ambiva­lence and laugh­ter. But the remain­der is the third, and per­haps the only one, the two others amount­ing to this as to the very figure of reversibil­ity. For why does one laugh? One only laughs at the reversibil­ity of things, and sex and death are emi­nently reversible fig­ures. It is because the stake is always reversible between mas­cu­line and fem­i­nine, between life and death, that one laughs at sex and death. How much more, then, at the remain­der, which does not even have an oppos­ing term, which by itself tra­verses the whole cycle, and runs infin­itely after its own slash, after its own double, like Peter Schlemihl after his shadow?<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> The remain­der is obscene, because it is reversible and is exchanged for itself. It is obscene and makes one laugh, as only the lack of dis­tinc­tion between mas­cu­line and fem­i­nine, the lack of dis­tinc­tion between life and death makes one laugh, deeply laugh.</p>
<p>Today, the remain­der has become the weighty term. It is on the remain­der that a new intel­li­gi­bil­ity is founded. End of a cer­tain logic of dis­tinc­tive oppo­si­tions, in which the weak term played the role of the resid­ual term. Today, every­thing is inverted. Psy­cho­anal­y­sis itself is the first great the­o­riza­tion of residues (lapses, dreams, etc.). It is no longer a polit­i­cal econ­omy of pro­duc­tion that directs us, but an eco­nomic pol­i­tics of repro­duc­tion, of recy­cling-ecol­ogy and pol­lu­tion-a polit­i­cal econ­omy of the remain­der. All nor­mal­ity sees itself today in the light of mad­ness, which was noth­ing but its insignif­i­cant remain­der. Priv­i­lege of all the remain­ders, in all domains, of the not—said, the fem­i­nine, the crazy, the mar­ginal, of excre­ment and waste in art, etc. But this is still noth­ing but a sort of inver­sion of the struc­ture, of the return of the repressed as a pow­er­ful moment, of the return of the remain­der as sur­plus of mean­ing, as excess (but excess is not for­mally dif­fer­ent from the remain­der, and the prob­lem of the squan­der­ing of excess in Bataille is not dif­fer­ent from that of the reab­sorp­tion of remain­ders in a polit­i­cal econ­omy of cal­cu­la­tion and penury, only the philoso­phies are dif­fer­ent), of a higher order of mean­ing start­ing with the remain­der. The secret of all the “lib­er­a­tions” that play on the hidden ener­gies on the other side of the slash.</p>
<p>Now we are faced with a much more orig­i­nal sit­u­a­tion: not that of the pure and simple inver­sion and pro­mo­tion of remain­ders, but that of an insta­bil­ity in every struc­ture and every oppo­si­tion that makes it so that <em>there is no longer even a remain­der</em>, due to the fact that the remain­der is every­where, and by play­ing with the slash, it annuls itself as such.</p>
<p>It is not when one has taken every­thing away that noth­ing is left, rather, noth­ing is left when things are unceas­ingly shifted and addi­tion itself no longer has any mean­ing.</p>
<p>Birth is resid­ual if it is not sym­bol­i­cally revis­ited through ini­ti­a­tion.</p>
<p>Death is resid­ual if it is not resolved in mourn­ing, in the col­lec­tive cel­e­bra­tion of mourn­ing.</p>
<p>Value is resid­ual if it is not reab­sorbed and voli­tal­ized in the cycle of exchanges.</p>
<p>Sex­u­al­ity is resid­ual once it becomes the pro­duc­tion of sexual rela­tions.</p>
<p>The social itself is resid­ual once it becomes a pro­duc­tion of “social rela­tions.”</p>
<p>All of the real is resid­ual, and every­thing that is resid­ual is des­tined to repeat itself indef­i­nitely in phan­tasms.</p>
<p>All accu­mu­la­tion is noth­ing but a remain­der, and the accu­mu­la­tion of remain­ders, in the sense that it is a rup­ture of alliance, and in the linear infin­ity of accu­mu­la­tion and cal­cu­la­tion, in the linear infin­ity of pro­duc­tion, com­pen­sates for the energy and value that used to be accom­plished in the cycle of alliance. Now, what tra­verses a cycle is com­pletely real­ized, whereas in the dimen­sion of the infi­nite, every­thing that is below the line of the infi­nite, below the line of eter­nity (this stock­pile of time that itself is also, as with any stock­pile, a rup­ture of alliances), all of that is noth­ing but the remain­der.</p>
<p>Accu­mu­la­tion is noth­ing but the remain­der, and repres­sion is noth­ing but its inverse and asym­met­ri­cal form. It is on the stock­pile of repressed affects and rep­re­sen­ta­tions that our new alliance is based.</p>
<p>But when every­thing is repressed, noth­ing is any­more. We are not far from this abso­lute point of repres­sion where the stock­piles are them­selves undone, where the stock­piles of phan­tasms col­lapse. The whole imag­i­nary of the stock­pile, of energy, and of what remains of it, comes to us from repres­sion. When repres­sion reaches a point of crit­i­cal sat­u­ra­tion where its pres­ence is put in ques­tion, then energy will no longer be avail­able to be lib­er­ated, spent, econ­o­mized, pro­duced: it is the con­cept of energy itself that will be volatilized of its own accord.</p>
<p>Today the remain­der, the ener­gies left us, the resti­tu­tion and the con­ser­va­tion of remain­ders, is the cru­cial prob­lem of human­ity. It is insol­u­ble in and of itself. All new freed or spent energy will leave a new remain­der. All desire, all libid­i­nal energy, will pro­duce a new repres­sion. What is sur­pris­ing in this, given that energy itself is not con­ceived except in the move­ment that stock­piles and lib­er­ates it, that represses it and “pro­duces” it, that is to say in the figure of the remain­der and its double?</p>
<p>One must push at the insane con­sump­tion of energy in order to exter­mi­nate its con­cept. One must push at max­i­mal repres­sion in order to exter­mi­nate its con­cept. Once the last liter of energy has been con­sumed (by the last ecol­o­gist), once the last indige­nous person has been ana­lyzed (by the last eth­nol­o­gist), once the ulti­mate com­mod­ity has been pro­duced by the last “work force,” then one will real­ize that this gigan­tic spiral of energy and pro­duc­tion, of repres­sion and the uncon­scious, thanks to which one has man­aged to enclose every­thing in an entropic and cat­a­strophic equa­tion, that all this is in effect noth­ing but a meta­physics of the remain­der, and it will sud­denly be resolved in all its effects.</p>

<h1>The Spiraling Cadaver</h1>
<div class="initial">
<p>The uni­ver­sity is in ruins: non­func­tional in the social arenas of the market and employ­ment, lack­ing cul­tural sub­stance or an end pur­pose of knowl­edge.</p>
</div>
<p>Strictly speak­ing, there is no longer even any power: it is also in ruins. Whence the impos­si­bil­ity of the return of the fires of 1968: of the return of putting in ques­tion knowl­edge versus power itself—the explo­sive con­tra­dic­tion of knowl­edge and power (or the rev­e­la­tion of their col­lu­sion, which comes to the same thing) in the uni­ver­sity, and, at the same time, through sym­bolic (rather than polit­i­cal) con­ta­gion in the whole insti­tu­tional and social order. <em>Why soci­ol­o­gists</em>? marked this shift: the impasse of knowl­edge, the ver­tigo of non­knowl­edge (that is to say at once the absur­dity and the impos­si­bil­ity of accu­mu­lat­ing value in the order of knowl­edge) turns like an abso­lute weapon against power itself, in order to dis­man­tle it accord­ing to the same ver­tig­i­nous sce­nario of dis­pos­ses­sion. This is the May 1968 effect. Today it cannot be achieved since power itself, after knowl­edge, has taken off, has become ungras­pable—has dis­pos­sessed itself. In a now uncer­tain insti­tu­tion, with­out knowl­edge con­tent, with­out a power struc­ture (except for an archaic feu­dal­ism that turns a sim­u­lacrum of a machine whose des­tiny escapes it and whose sur­vival is as arti­fi­cial as that of bar­racks and the­aters), offen­sive irrup­tion is impos­si­ble. Only what pre­cip­i­tates rot­ting, by accen­tu­at­ing the par­o­dic, sim­u­lacral side of dying games of knowl­edge and power, has mean­ing.</p>
<p>A strike has exactly the oppo­site effect. It regen­er­ates the ideal of a pos­si­ble uni­ver­sity: the fic­tion of an ascen­sion on every­one’s part to a cul­ture that is unlo­cat­able, and that no longer has mean­ing. This ideal is sub­sti­tuted for the oper­a­tion of the uni­ver­sity as its crit­i­cal alter­na­tive, as its ther­apy. This fic­tion still dreams of a per­ma­nency and democ­racy of knowl­edge. Besides, every­where today the Left plays this role: it is the jus­tice of the Left that rein­jects an <em>idea</em> of jus­tice, the neces­sity of logic and social morals into a rotten appa­ra­tus that is coming undone, which is losing all con­science of its legit­i­macy and renounces func­tion­ing almost of its own voli­tion. It is the Left that secrets and des­per­ately repro­duces power, because it wants power, and there­fore the Left believes in it and revives it pre­cisely where the system puts an end to it. The system puts an end one by one to all its axioms, to all its insti­tu­tions, and real­izes one by one all the objec­tives of the his­tor­i­cal and rev­o­lu­tion­ary Left that sees itself con­strained to revive the wheels of cap­i­tal in order to lay siege to them one day: from pri­vate prop­erty to the small busi­ness, from the army to national grandeur, from puri­tan moral­ity to petit bour­geois cul­ture, jus­tice at the uni­ver­sity—every­thing that is dis­ap­pear­ing, that the system itself, in its atroc­ity, cer­tainly, but also in its irre­versible impulse, has liq­ui­dated, must be con­served.</p>
<p>Whence the para­dox­i­cal but nec­es­sary inver­sion of all the terms of polit­i­cal anal­y­sis.</p>
<p>Power (or what takes its place) no longer believes in the uni­ver­sity. It knows fun­da­men­tally that it is only a zone for the shel­ter and sur­veil­lance of a whole class of a cer­tain age, it there­fore has only to select—it will find its elite else­where, or by other means. Diplo­mas are worth­less: why would it refuse to award them, in any case it is ready to award them to every­body; why this provoca­tive pol­i­tics, if not in order to crys­tal­lize ener­gies on a fic­tive stake (selec­tion, work, diplo­mas, etc.), on an already dead and rot­ting ref­er­en­tial?</p>
<p>By rot­ting, the uni­ver­sity can still do a lot of damage (rot­ting is a <em>sym­bolic</em> mech­a­nism not polit­i­cal but sym­bolic, there­fore sub­ver­sive for us). But for this to be the case it is nec­es­sary to start with this very rot­ting, and not to dream of res­ur­rec­tion. It is nec­es­sary to trans­form this rot­ting into a vio­lent process, into vio­lent death, through mock­ery and defi­ance, through a mul­ti­plied sim­u­la­tion that would offer the ritual of the death of the uni­ver­sity as a model of decom­po­si­tion to the whole of soci­ety, a con­ta­gious model of the dis­af­fec­tion of a whole social struc­ture, where death would finally make its rav­ages, which the strike tries des­per­ately to avert, in com­plic­ity with the system, but suc­ceeds, on top of it all, only in trans­form­ing the uni­ver­sity into a slow death, a delay that is not even the pos­si­ble site of a sub­ver­sion, of an offen­sive rever­sion.</p>
<p>That is what the events of May 1968 pro­duced. At a less advanced point in the process of the liq­ue­fac­tion of the uni­ver­sity and of cul­ture, the stu­dents, far from wish­ing to save the fur­ni­ture (revive the lost object, in an ideal mode), retorted by con­fronting power with the chal­lenge of the total, imme­di­ate death of the insti­tu­tion, the chal­lenge of a deter­ri­to­ri­al­iza­tion even more intense than the one that came from the system, and by sum­mon­ing power to respond to this total derail­ment of the insti­tu­tion of knowl­edge, to this total lack of a need to gather in a given place, this death desired in the end—not the <em>crisis</em> of the uni­ver­sity, that is not a chal­lenge, on the con­trary, it is the game of the system, but the <em>death</em> of the uni­ver­sity—to that chal­lenge, power has not been able to respond, except by its own dis­so­lu­tion in return (only for a moment maybe, but we saw it).</p>
<p>The bar­ri­cades of 10 May seemed defen­sive and to be defend­ing a <em>ter­ri­tory</em>: the Latin Quar­ter, old bou­tique. But this is not true: behind this facade, it was the dead uni­ver­sity, the dead cul­ture whose chal­lenge they were launch­ing at power, and their own even­tual death at the same time—a trans­for­ma­tion into <em>imme­di­ate sac­ri­fice</em>, which was only the <em>long-term</em> oper­a­tion of the system itself: the liq­ui­da­tion of cul­ture and of knowl­edge. They were not there to save the Sor­bonne, but to bran­dish its cadaver in the face of the others, just as black people in Watts and in Detroit bran­dished the ruins of their neigh­bor­hoods to which they had them­selves set fire.</p>
<p>What can one bran­dish today? No longer even the ruins of knowl­edge, of cul­ture—the ruins them­selves are defunct. We know it, we have mourned Nan­terre for seven years. 1968 is dead, repeat­able only as a phan­tasm of mourn­ing. What would be the equiv­a­lent in sym­bolic vio­lence (that is to say beyond the polit­i­cal) would be the same oper­a­tion that caused non­knowl­edge, the rot­ting of knowl­edge to come up against power—no longer dis­cov­er­ing this fab­u­lous energy on the same level at all, but on the supe­rior spiral: caus­ing non­power, the rot­ting of power to come up against—against what pre­cisely? There lies the prob­lem. It is per­haps insol­u­ble. Power is being lost, power has been lost. All around us there are noth­ing but dum­mies of power, but the mechan­i­cal illu­sion of power still rules the social order, behind which grows the absent, illeg­i­ble, terror of con­trol, the terror of a defin­i­tive code, of which we are the minus­cule ter­mi­nals.</p>
<p>Attack­ing rep­re­sen­ta­tion no longer has much mean­ing either. One senses quite clearly, for the same reason, that all stu­dent con­flicts (as is the case, more broadly, on the level of global soci­ety) around the rep­re­sen­ta­tion, the del­e­ga­tion of power are no longer any­thing but phan­tom vicis­si­tudes that yet still manage, out of despair, to occupy the fore­front of the stage. Through I don’t know what Möbius effect, rep­re­sen­ta­tion itself has also turned in on itself, and the whole log­i­cal uni­verse of the polit­i­cal is dis­solved at the same time, ceding its place to a trans­fi­nite uni­verse of sim­u­la­tion, where from the begin­ning no one is rep­re­sented nor rep­re­sen­ta­tive of any­thing any more, where all that is accu­mu­lated is deac­cu­mu­lated at the same time, where even the axi­o­log­i­cal, direc­tive, and sal­vage­able phan­tasm of power has dis­ap­peared. A uni­verse that is still incom­pre­hen­si­ble, unrec­og­niz­able, to us, a uni­verse with a malefic curve that our mental coor­di­nates, which are orthog­o­nal and pre­pared for the infi­nite lin­ear­ity of crit­i­cism and his­tory, vio­lently resist. Yet it is there that one must fight, if even fight­ing has any mean­ing any­more. We are sim­u­la­tors, we are sim­u­lacra (not in the clas­si­cal sense of “appear­ance”), we are con­cave mir­rors radi­ated by the social, a radi­a­tion with­out a light source, power with­out origin, with­out dis­tance, and it is in this tac­ti­cal uni­verse of the sim­u­lacrum that one will need to fight—with­out hope, hope is a weak value, but in defi­ance and fas­ci­na­tion. Because one must not refuse the intense fas­ci­na­tion that emanates from this liq­ue­fac­tion of all power, of all axes of value, of all axi­ol­ogy, pol­i­tics included. This spec­ta­cle, which is at once that of the death throes and the apogee of cap­i­tal, sur­passes by far that of the com­mod­ity described by the sit­u­a­tion­ists. This spec­ta­cle is our essen­tial force. We are no longer in a rela­tion toward cap­i­tal of uncer­tain or vic­to­ri­ous forces, but in a polit­i­cal one, <em>that</em> is the phan­tasm of rev­o­lu­tion. We are in a rela­tion of defi­ance, of seduc­tion, and of death toward this uni­verse that is no longer one, pre­cisely because all axi­al­ity that escapes it. The chal­lenge cap­i­tal directs at us in its delir­ium—liq­ui­dat­ing with­out shame the law of profit, sur­plus value, pro­duc­tive final­i­ties, struc­tures of power, and find­ing at the end of its process the pro­found immoral­ity (but also the seduc­tion) of prim­i­tive rit­u­als of destruc­tion, this very chal­lenge must be raised to an insanely higher level. Cap­i­tal, like value, is irre­spon­si­ble, irre­versible, ineluctable. Only to value is cap­i­tal capa­ble of offer­ing a fan­tas­tic spec­ta­cle of its decom­po­si­tion—only the phan­tom of value still floats over the desert of the clas­si­cal struc­tures of cap­i­tal, just as the phan­tom of reli­gion floats over a world now long desacral­ized, just as the phan­tom of knowl­edge floats over the uni­ver­sity. It is up to us to again become the nomads of this desert, but dis­en­gaged from the mechan­i­cal illu­sion of value. We will live in this world, which for us has all the dis­qui­et­ing strange­ness of the desert and of the sim­u­lacrum, with all the verac­ity of living phan­toms, of wan­der­ing and sim­u­lat­ing ani­mals that cap­i­tal, that <em>the death of cap­i­tal</em> has made of us—because the desert of cities is equal to the desert of sand—the jungle of signs is equal to that of the forests—the ver­tigo of sim­u­lacra is equal to that of nature—only the ver­tig­i­nous seduc­tion of a dying system remains, in which work buries work, in which value buries value—leav­ing a virgin, sacred space with­out path­ways, con­tin­u­ous as Bataille wished it, where only the wind lifts the sand, where only the wind watches over the sand.</p>
<p>What can one make of all this in the polit­i­cal order? Very little.</p>
<p>But we also have to fight against the pro­found fas­ci­na­tion exerted on us by the death throes of cap­i­tal, against the stag­ing by cap­i­tal of its own death, when we are really the ones in our final hours. To leave it the ini­tia­tive of its own death, is to leave it all the priv­i­leges of rev­o­lu­tion. Sur­rounded by the <em>sim­u­lacrum</em> of value and by the <em>phan­tom</em> of cap­i­tal and of power, we are much more dis­armed and impo­tent than when sur­rounded by the <em>law</em> of value and of the com­mod­ity, since the system has revealed itself capa­ble of inte­grat­ing its own death and since we are relieved of the respon­si­bil­ity for this death, and thus of the stake of our own life. This supreme ruse of the system, that of the sim­u­lacrum of its death, through which it main­tains us in life by having liq­ui­dated through absorp­tion all pos­si­ble neg­a­tiv­ity, only a supe­rior ruse can stop. Chal­lenge or imag­i­nary sci­ence, only a <em>pat­a­physics of sim­u­lacra</em> can remove us from the system’s strat­egy of sim­u­la­tion and the impasse of death in which it impris­ons us.</p>

<p>Panic on the part of uni­ver­sity admin­is­tra­tors at the idea that diplo­mas will be awarded with­out a “real”-work coun­ter­part, with­out an equiv­a­lence in knowl­edge. This panic is not that of polit­i­cal sub­ver­sion, it is that of seeing value become dis­so­ci­ated from its con­tents and begin to func­tion alone, accord­ing to its very form. The values of the uni­ver­sity (diplo­mas, etc.) will pro­lif­er­ate and con­tinue to cir­cu­late, a bit like float­ing cap­i­tal or Eurodol­lars, they will spiral with­out ref­er­en­tial cri­te­ria, com­pletely deval­orized in the end, but that is unim­por­tant: their cir­cu­la­tion alone is enough to create a social hori­zon of value, and the ghostly pres­ence of the phan­tom value will only be greater, even when its ref­er­ence point (its use value, its exchange value, the aca­demic “work force” that the uni­ver­sity recoops) is lost. Terror of value with­out equiv­a­lence.</p>
</div>
<p>This sit­u­a­tion only appears to be new. It is so for those who still think that a real process of work takes place in the uni­ver­sity, and who invest their lived expe­ri­ence, their neu­roses, their raison d’être in it. The exchange of signs (of knowl­edge, of cul­ture) in the uni­ver­sity, between “teach­ers” and “taught” has for some time been noth­ing but a dou­bled col­lu­sion of bit­ter­ness and indif­fer­ence (the indif­fer­ence of signs that brings with it the dis­af­fec­tion of social and human rela­tions), a dou­bled sim­u­lacrum of a psy­chodrama (that of a demand hot with shame, pres­ence, oedi­pal exchange, with <em>ped­a­gog­i­cal incest</em> that strives to sub­sti­tute itself for the lost exchange of work and knowl­edge). In this sense the uni­ver­sity remains the site of a <em>des­per­ate ini­ti­a­tion to the empty form of value</em>, and those who have lived there for the past few years are famil­iar with this strange work, the true des­per­a­tion of non­work, of non­knowl­edge. Because cur­rent gen­er­a­tions still dream of read­ing, of learn­ing, of com­pet­ing, but their heart isn’t in it—as a whole, the ascetic cul­tural men­tal­ity has run body and pos­ses­sions together. This is why the strike no longer means any­thing.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>
<p>It is also why we were trapped, we trapped our­selves, after 1968, into giving diplo­mas to every­body. Sub­ver­sion? Not at all. Once again, we were the pro­mot­ers of the advanced form, of the pure form of value: diplo­mas with­out work. The system does not want any more diplo­mas, but it wants that—oper­a­tional values in the void—and we were the ones who inau­gu­rated it, with the illu­sion of doing the oppo­site.</p>
<p>The stu­dents’ dis­tress at having diplo­mas con­ferred on them for no work com­ple­ments and is equal to that of the teach­ers. It is more secret and more insid­i­ous than the tra­di­tional anguish of fail­ure or of receiv­ing worth­less diplo­mas. No-risk insur­ance on the diploma—which emp­ties the vicis­si­tudes of knowl­edge and selec­tion of con­tent—is hard to bear. Also it must be com­pli­cated by either a ben­e­fit—alibi, a sim­u­lacrum of work exchanged against a sim­u­lacrum of a diploma, or by a form of aggres­sion (the teacher called on to give the course, or treated as the auto­matic dis­trib­u­tor) or by rancor, so that at least some­thing will still take place that resem­bles a “real” rela­tion. But noth­ing works. Even the domes­tic squab­bles between teach­ers and stu­dents, which today make up a great part of their exchanges, are noth­ing but the rec­ol­lec­tion of, and a kind of nos­tal­gia for a vio­lence or a com­plic­ity that hereto­fore made them ene­mies or united them around a stake of knowl­edge or a polit­i­cal stake.</p>
<p>The “hard law of value,” the “law set in stone”—when it aban­dons us, what sad­ness, what panic! This is why there are still good days left to fas­cist and author­i­tar­ian meth­ods, because they revive some­thing of the vio­lence nec­es­sary to life—whether suf­fered or inflicted. The vio­lence of ritual, the vio­lence of work, the vio­lence of knowl­edge, the vio­lence of blood, the vio­lence of power and of the polit­i­cal is good! It is clear, lumi­nous, the rela­tions of force, con­tra­dic­tions, exploita­tion, repres­sion! This is lack­ing today, and the need for it makes itself felt. The teacher’s rein­vest­ment of his power through “free speech,” the self-man­age­ment of the group and other modern non­sense—it is still all a game, for exam­ple, in the uni­ver­sity (but the entire polit­i­cal sphere is artic­u­lated in the same way). No one is fooled. Simply in order to escape pro­found dis­il­lu­sion­ment, to escape the catas­tro­phe brought on by the loss of roles, statutes, respon­si­bil­i­ties, and the incred­i­ble dem­a­goguery that is deployed through them, it is nec­es­sary to recre­ate the pro­fes­sor either as a man­nequin of power and knowl­edge, or to invest him with a mod­icum of legit­i­macy derived from the ultra-Left—if not the sit­u­a­tion is intol­er­a­ble for every­one. It is based on this com­pro­mise—arti­fi­cial fig­u­ra­tion of the teacher, equiv­o­cal com­plic­ity on the part of the stu­dent—it is based on this phan­tom sce­nario of ped­a­gogy that things con­tinue and this time can last indef­i­nitely. Because there is an end to value and to work, there is none to the sim­u­lacrum of value and of work. The uni­verse of sim­u­la­tion is tran­sreal and trans­fi­nite: no test of real­ity will come to put an end to it except the total col­lapse and slip­page of the ter­rain, which remains our most fool­ish hope.</p>

<section id="on-nihilism" class="level1">
<h1>On Nihilism</h1>
<div class="initial">
<p>Nihilism no longer wears the dark, Wag­ne­r­ian, Spen­g­le­rian, fulig­i­nous colors of the end of the cen­tury. It no longer comes from a weltan­schau­ung of deca­dence nor from a meta­phys­i­cal rad­i­cal­ity born of the death of God and of all the con­se­quences that must be taken from this death. Today’s nihilism is one of trans­parency, and it is in some sense more rad­i­cal, more cru­cial than in its prior and his­tor­i­cal forms, because this trans­parency, this irres­o­lu­tion is indis­sol­ubly that of the system, and that of all the theory that still pre­tends to ana­lyze it. When God died, there was still Niet­zsche to say so—the great nihilist before the Eter­nal and the cadaver of the Eter­nal. But before the sim­u­lated trans­parency of all things, before the sim­u­lacrum of the mate­ri­al­ist or ide­al­ist real­iza­tion of the world in hyper­re­al­ity (God is not dead, he has become hyper-real), there is no longer a the­o­ret­i­cal or crit­i­cal God to rec­og­nize his own.</p>
</div>
<p>The uni­verse, and all of us, have entered live into sim­u­la­tion, into the malefic, not even malefic, indif­fer­ent, sphere of deter­rence: in a bizarre fash­ion, nihilism has been entirely real­ized no longer through destruc­tion, but through sim­u­la­tion and deter­rence. From the active, vio­lent phan­tasm, from the phan­tasm of the myth and the stage that it also was, his­tor­i­cally, it has passed into the trans­par­ent, falsely trans­par­ent, oper­a­tion of things. What then remains of a pos­si­ble nihilism in theory? What new scene can unfold, where noth­ing and death could be replayed as a <em>chal­lenge</em>, as a stake?</p>
<p>We are in a new, and with­out a doubt insol­u­ble, posi­tion in rela­tion to prior forms of nihilism:</p>
<p>Roman­ti­cism is its first great man­i­fes­ta­tion: it, along with the Enlight­en­ment’s Rev­o­lu­tion, cor­re­sponds to the destruc­tion of the order of appear­ances.</p>
<p>Sur­re­al­ism, dada, the absurd, and polit­i­cal nihilism are the second great man­i­fes­ta­tion, which cor­re­sponds to the destruc­tion of the order of mean­ing.</p>
<p>The first is still an aes­thetic form of nihilism (dandy­ism), the second, a polit­i­cal, his­tor­i­cal, and meta­phys­i­cal form (ter­ror­ism).</p>
<p>These two forms no longer con­cern us except in part, or not at all. The nihilism of trans­parency is no longer either aes­thetic or polit­i­cal, no longer bor­rows from either the exter­mi­na­tion of appear­ances, nor from extin­guish­ing the embers of mean­ing, nor from the last nuances of an apoc­a­lypse. There is no longer an apoc­a­lypse (only aleatory ter­ror­ism still tries to reflect it, but it is cer­tainly no longer polit­i­cal, and it only has one mode of man­i­fes­ta­tion left that is at the same time a mode of dis­ap­pear­ance: the media now the media are not a stage where some­thing is played, they are a strip, a track, a per­fo­rated map of which we are no longer even spec­ta­tors: receivers). The apoc­a­lypse is fin­ished, today it is the pre­ces­sion of the neu­tral, of forms of the neu­tral and of indif­fer­ence. I will leave it to be con­sid­ered whether there can be a roman­ti­cism, an aes­thetic of the neu­tral therein. I don’t think so—all that remains, is the fas­ci­na­tion for desert­like and indif­fer­ent forms, for the very oper­a­tion of the system that anni­hi­lates us. Now, fas­ci­na­tion (in con­trast to seduc­tion, which was attached to appear­ances, and to dialec­ti­cal reason, which was attached to mean­ing) is a nihilis­tic pas­sion par excel­lence, it is the pas­sion proper to the mode of dis­ap­pear­ance. We are fas­ci­nated by all forms of dis­ap­pear­ance, of our dis­ap­pear­ance. Melan­cholic and fas­ci­nated, such is our gen­eral sit­u­a­tion in an era of invol­un­tary trans­parency.</p>
<div class="noindent break">
<p>I am a nihilist.</p>
</div>
<p>I observe, I accept, I assume the immense process of the destruc­tion of appear­ances (and of the seduc­tion of appear­ances) in the ser­vice of mean­ing (rep­re­sen­ta­tion, his­tory, crit­i­cism, etc.) that is the fun­da­men­tal fact of the nine­teenth cen­tury. The true rev­o­lu­tion of the nine­teenth cen­tury, of moder­nity, is the rad­i­cal destruc­tion of appear­ances, the dis­en­chant­ment of the world and its aban­don­ment to the vio­lence of inter­pre­ta­tion and of his­tory.</p>
<p>I observe, I accept, I assume, I ana­lyze the second rev­o­lu­tion, that of the twen­ti­eth cen­tury, that of post­moder­nity, which is the immense process of the destruc­tion of mean­ing, equal to the ear­lier destruc­tion of appear­ances. He who strikes with mean­ing is killed by mean­ing.</p>
<p>The dia­lec­tic stage, the crit­i­cal stage is empty. There is no more stage. There is no ther­apy of mean­ing or ther­apy through mean­ing: ther­apy itself is part of the gen­er­al­ized process of indif­fer­en­ti­a­tion.</p>
<p>The stage of anal­y­sis itself has become uncer­tain, aleatory: the­o­ries float (in fact, nihilism is impos­si­ble, because it is still a des­per­ate but deter­mined theory, an imag­i­nary of the end, a weltan­schau­ung of catas­tro­phe).<a href="#fn26" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>
<p>Anal­y­sis is itself per­haps the deci­sive ele­ment of the immense process of the freez­ing over of mean­ing. The sur­plus of mean­ing that the­o­ries bring, their com­pe­ti­tion at the level of mean­ing is com­pletely sec­ondary in rela­tion to their coali­tion in the glacial and four-tiered oper­a­tion of dis­sec­tion and trans­parency. One must be con­scious that, no matter how the anal­y­sis pro­ceeds, it pro­ceeds toward the freez­ing over of mean­ing, it assists in the pre­ces­sion of sim­u­lacra and of indif­fer­ent forms. The desert grows.</p>
<p>Implo­sion of mean­ing in the media. Implo­sion of the social in the masses. Infi­nite growth of the masses as a func­tion of the accel­er­a­tion of the system. Ener­getic impasse. Point of iner­tia.</p>
<p>A des­tiny of iner­tia for a sat­u­rated world. The phe­nom­ena of iner­tia are accel­er­at­ing (if one can say that). The arrested forms pro­lif­er­ate, and growth is immo­bi­lized in excres­cence. Such is also the secret of the hyper­telie, of what goes fur­ther than its own end. It would be our own mode of destroy­ing final­i­ties: going fur­ther, too far in the same direc­tion—destruc­tion of mean­ing through sim­u­la­tion, hyper­sim­u­la­tion, hyper­telie. Deny­ing its own end through hyper­fi­nal­ity (the crus­tacean, the stat­ues of Easter Island) is this not also the obscene secret of cancer? Revenge of excres­cence on growth, revenge of speed on iner­tia.</p>
<p>The masses them­selves are caught up in a gigan­tic process of iner­tia through accel­er­a­tion. They are this excres­cent, devour­ing, process that anni­hi­lates all growth and all sur­plus mean­ing. They are this cir­cuit short-cir­cuited by a mon­strous final­ity.</p>
<p>It is this point of iner­tia and what hap­pens out­side this point of iner­tia that today is fas­ci­nat­ing, enthralling (gone, there­fore, the dis­creet charm of the dia­lec­tic). If it is nihilis­tic to priv­i­lege this point of iner­tia and the anal­y­sis of this irre­versibil­ity of sys­tems up to the point of no return, then I am a nihilist.</p>
<p>If it is nihilis­tic to be obsessed by the mode of dis­ap­pear­ance, and no longer by the mode of pro­duc­tion, then I am a nihilist. Dis­ap­pear­ance, aphani­sis, implo­sion, Fury of <em>Ver­schwindens</em>. Trans­pol­i­tics is the elec­tive sphere of the mode of dis­ap­pear­ance (of the real, of mean­ing, of the stage, of his­tory, of the social, of the indi­vid­ual). To tell the truth, it is no longer so much a ques­tion of nihilism: in dis­ap­pear­ance, in the desert­like, aleatory, and indif­fer­ent form, there is no longer even pathos, the pathetic of nihilism that myth­i­cal energy that is still the force of nihilism, of rad­i­cal­ity, mythic denial, dra­matic antic­i­pa­tion. It is no longer even dis­en­chant­ment, with the seduc­tive and nos­tal­gic, itself enchanted, tonal­ity of dis­en­chant­ment. It is simply dis­ap­pear­ance.</p>
<p>The trace of this rad­i­cal­ity of the mode of dis­ap­pear­ance is already found in Adorno and Ben­jamin, par­al­lel to a nos­tal­gic exer­cise of the dia­lec­tic. Because there is a nos­tal­gia of the dia­lec­tic, and with­out a doubt the most subtle dia­lec­tic is nos­tal­gic to begin with. But more deeply, there is in Ben­jamin and Adorno another tonal­ity, that of a melan­choly attached to the system itself, one that is incur­able and beyond any dia­lec­tic. It is this melan­cho­lia of sys­tems that today takes the upper hand through the iron­i­cally trans­par­ent forms that sur­round us. It is this melan­cho­lia that is becom­ing our fun­da­men­tal pas­sion.</p>
<p>It is no longer the spleen or the vague yearn­ings of the fin-de-siècle soul. It is no longer nihilism either, which in some sense aims at nor­mal­iz­ing every­thing through destruc­tion, the pas­sion of resent­ment (<em>ressen­ti­ment</em>).<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> No, melan­cho­lia is the fun­da­men­tal tonal­ity of func­tional sys­tems, of cur­rent sys­tems of sim­u­la­tion, of pro­gram­ming and infor­ma­tion. Melan­cho­lia is the inher­ent qual­ity of the mode of the dis­ap­pear­ance of mean­ing, of the mode of the volatiliza­tion of mean­ing in oper­a­tional sys­tems. And we are all melan­cholic.</p>
<p>Melan­cho­lia is the brutal dis­af­fec­tion that char­ac­ter­izes our sat­u­rated sys­tems. Once the hope of bal­anc­ing good and evil, true and false, indeed of con­fronting some values of the same order, once the more gen­eral hope of a rela­tion of forces and a stake has van­ished. Every­where, always, the system is too strong: hege­monic.</p>
<p>Against this hege­mony of the system, one can exalt the ruses of desire, prac­tice rev­o­lu­tion­ary microl­ogy of the quo­tid­ian, exalt the molec­u­lar drift or even defend cook­ing. This does not resolve the impe­ri­ous neces­sity of check­ing the system in broad day­light.</p>
<p>This, only ter­ror­ism can do.</p>
<p>It is the trait of rever­sion that effaces the remain­der, just as a single ironic smile effaces a whole dis­course, just as a single flash of denial in a slave effaces all the power and plea­sure of the master.</p>
<p>The more hege­monic the system, the more the imag­i­na­tion is struck by the small­est of its rever­sals. The chal­lenge, even infin­i­tes­i­mal, is the image of a chain fail­ure. Only this reversibil­ity with­out a coun­ter­part is an event today, on the nihilis­tic and dis­af­fected stage of the polit­i­cal. Only it mobi­lizes the imag­i­nary.</p>
<p>If being a nihilist, is car­ry­ing, to the unbear­able limit of hege­monic sys­tems, this rad­i­cal trait of deri­sion and of vio­lence, this chal­lenge that the system is sum­moned to answer through its own death, then I am a ter­ror­ist and nihilist in theory as the others are with their weapons. The­o­ret­i­cal vio­lence, not truth, is the only resource left us.</p>
<p>But such a sen­ti­ment is utopian. Because it would be beau­ti­ful to be a nihilist, if there were still a rad­i­cal­ity—as it would be nice to be a ter­ror­ist, if death, includ­ing that of the ter­ror­ist, still had mean­ing.</p>
<p>But it is at this point that things become insol­u­ble. Because to this active nihilism of rad­i­cal­ity, the system opposes its own, the nihilism of neu­tral­iza­tion. The system is itself also nihilis­tic, in the sense that it has the power to pour every­thing, includ­ing what denies it, into indif­fer­ence.</p>
<p>In this system, death itself shines by virtue of its absence. (The Bologna train sta­tion, the Okto­ber­fest in Munich: the dead are annulled by indif­fer­ence, that is where ter­ror­ism is the invol­un­tary accom­plice of the whole system, not polit­i­cally, but in the accel­er­ated form of indif­fer­ence that it con­trib­utes to impos­ing.)</p>
<p>Death no longer has a stage, nei­ther phan­tas­matic nor polit­i­cal, on which to rep­re­sent itself, to play itself out, either a cer­e­mo­nial or a vio­lent one. And this is the vic­tory of the other nihilism, of the other ter­ror­ism, that of the system.</p>
<p>There is no longer a stage, not even the min­i­mal illu­sion that makes events capa­ble of adopt­ing the force of real­ity-no more stage either of mental or polit­i­cal sol­i­dar­ity: what do Chile, Biafra, the boat people, Bologna, or Poland matter? All of that comes to be anni­hi­lated on the tele­vi­sion screen. We are in the era of events with­out con­se­quences (and of the­o­ries with­out con­se­quences).</p>
<p>There is no more hope for mean­ing. And with­out a doubt this is a good thing: mean­ing is mortal. But that on which it has imposed its ephemeral reign, what it hoped to liq­ui­date in order to impose the reign of the Enlight­en­ment, that is, appear­ances, they, are immor­tal, invul­ner­a­ble to the nihilism of mean­ing or of non-mean­ing itself.</p>
<p>This is where seduc­tion begins.</p>

<li id="fn6"><p><a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back">6.</a> To this flag­ging invest­ment in work cor­re­sponds a par­al­lel decline in the invest­ment in con­sump­tion. Good­bye to use value or to the pres­tige of the auto­mo­bile, good­bye amorous dis­cour­ses that neatly opposed the object of enjoy­ment to the object of work. Another dis­course takes hold that is a <em>dis­course of work on the object of con­sump­tion</em> aiming for an active, con­strain­ing, puri­tan rein­vest­ment (use less gas, watch out for your safety, you’ve gone over the speed limit, etc.) to which the char­ac­ter­is­tics of auto­mo­biles pre­tend to adapt. Redis­cov­er­ing a stake through the trans­po­si­tion of these two poles. Work becomes the object of a need, the car becomes the object of work. There is no better proof of the lack of dif­fer­en­ti­a­tion among all the stakes. It is through the same slip­page between the “right” to vote and elec­toral “duty” that the divest­ment of the polit­i­cal sphere is sig­naled.</p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p><a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back">7.</a> The medium/mes­sage con­fu­sion is cer­tainly a corol­lary of that between the sender and the receiver, thus seal­ing the dis­ap­pear­ance of all dual, polar struc­tures that formed the dis­cur­sive orga­ni­za­tion of lan­guage, of all deter­mined artic­u­la­tion of mean­ing reflect­ing Jakob­son’s famous grid of func­tions. That dis­course “cir­cu­lates” is to be taken lit­er­ally: that is, it no longer goes from one point to another, but it tra­verses a cycle that <em>with­out dis­tinc­tion</em> includes the posi­tions of trans­mit­ter and receiver, now unlo­cat­able as such. Thus there is no instance of power, no instance of trans­mis­sion—power is some­thing that cir­cu­lates and whose source can no longer be located, a cycle in which the posi­tions of the dom­i­na­tor and the dom­i­nated are exchanged in an end­less rever­sion that is also the end of power in its clas­si­cal def­i­ni­tion. The cir­cu­lar­iza­tion of power, of knowl­edge, of dis­course puts an end to any local­iza­tion of instances and poles. In the psy­cho­an­a­lytic inter­pre­ta­tion itself, the “power” of the inter­preter does not come from any out­side instance but from the inter­preter him­self. This changes every­thing, because one can always ask of the tra­di­tional hold­ers of power where they get their power from. Who made you duke? The king. Who made you king? God. Only God no longer answers. But to the ques­tion: who made you a psy­cho­an­a­lyst? the ana­lyst can well reply: You. Thus is expressed, by an inverse sim­u­la­tion, the pas­sage from the “ana­lyzed” to the “analysand,” from pas­sive to active, which simply describes the spi­ral­ing effect of the shift­ing of poles, the effect of cir­cu­lar­ity in which power is lost, is dis­solved, is resolved in per­fect manip­u­la­tion (it is no longer of the order of direc­tive power and of the gaze, but of the order of tac­til­ity and com­mu­ta­tion). See also the state/family cir­cu­lar­ity assured by the fluc­tu­a­tion and metastatic reg­u­la­tion of the images of the social and the pri­vate (J. Donzelot, <em>La police des familles</em> [The polic­ing of fam­i­lies]).</p>
<p>Impos­si­ble now to pose the famous ques­tion: “From what posi­tion do you speak?”—“How do you know?” “From where do you get your power?” with­out hear­ing the imme­di­ate response: “But it is of you (from you) that I speak”—mean­ing, it is you who are speak­ing, you who know, you who are the power. Gigan­tic cir­cum­vo­lu­tion, cir­cum­lo­cu­tion of the spoken word, which is equal to a black­mail with no end, to a deter­rence that cannot be appealed of the sub­ject pre­sumed to speak, leav­ing him with­out a reply, because to the ques­tion that he poses one ineluctably replies: but <em>you are the answer</em>, or: your ques­tion is already an answer, etc.—the whole stran­gu­la­tory sophis­ti­ca­tion of inter­cept­ing speech, of the forced con­fes­sion in the guise of free­dom of expres­sion, of trap­ping the sub­ject in his own inter­ro­ga­tion, of the pre­ces­sion of the reply to the ques­tion (all the vio­lence of inter­pre­ta­tion lies there, as well as that of the con­scious or uncon­scious man­age­ment of the “spoken word” [<em>parole</em>]).</p>
<p>This sim­u­lacrum of the inver­sion or the invo­lu­tion of poles, this clever sub­terfuge, which is the secret of the whole dis­course of manip­u­la­tion and thus, today, in every domain, the secret of any new power in the era­sure of the scene of power, in the assump­tion of all words from which has resulted this fan­tas­tic silent major­ity char­ac­ter­is­tic of our time—all of this started with­out a doubt in the polit­i­cal sphere with the democ­rac­tic sim­u­lacrum, which today is the sub­sti­tu­tion for the power of God with the power of the people as the source of power, and of power as <em>ema­na­tion</em> with power as <em>rep­re­sen­ta­tion</em>. Anti-Coper­ni­can rev­o­lu­tion: no tran­scen­den­tal instance either of the sun or of the lumi­nous sources of power and knowl­edge—every­thing comes from the people and every­thing returns to them. It is with this mag­nif­i­cent recy­cling that the uni­ver­sal sim­u­lacrum of manip­u­la­tion, from the sce­nario of mass suf­frage to the present-day phan­toms of opin­ion polls, begins to be put in place.</p></li>

Ani­mals have never wan­dered, were never deter­ri­to­ri­al­ized. A whole lib­er­a­tory phan­tas­mago­ria is drawn in oppo­si­tion to the con­straints of modern soci­ety, a rep­re­sen­ta­tion of nature and of beasts as sav­agery, as the free­dom to”ful­fill all needs," today “of real­iz­ing all his desires” because modern Rousseauism has taken the form of the inde­ter­mi­nacy of drive, of the wan­der­ing of desire and of the nomadism of infini­tude—but it is the same mys­tique of unleashed, non­coded forces with no final­ity other than their own erup­tion.</p>
<p>Now, free, virgin nature, with­out limits or ter­ri­to­ries, where each wan­ders at will, never existed, except in the imag­i­nary of the dom­i­nant order, of which this nature is the equiv­a­lent mirror. We project (nature, desire, ani­mal­ity, rhi­zome … ) the very schema of deter­ri­to­ri­al­iza­tion that is that of the eco­nomic system and of cap­i­tal as ideal sav­agery. Lib­erty is nowhere but in cap­i­tal, it is what pro­duced it, it is what deep­ens it. There is thus an exact cor­re­la­tion between the social leg­is­la­tion of value (urban, indus­trial, repres­sive, etc.) and the imag­i­nary sav­agery one places in oppo­si­tion to it: they are both “deter­ri­to­ri­al­ized” and in each other’s image. More­over, the rad­i­cal­ity of “desire,” one sees this in cur­rent the­o­ries, increases at the same rate as civ­i­lized abstrac­tion, not at all antag­o­nis­ti­cally, but abso­lutely accord­ing to the same move­ment, that of the same form always more decoded, more decen­tered, “freer,” which simul­ta­ne­ously envelops our real and our imag­i­nary. Nature, lib­erty, desire, etc., do not even express a dream the oppo­site of cap­i­tal, they directly trans­late the progress or the rav­ages of this cul­ture, they even antic­i­pate it, because they dream of total deter­ri­to­ri­al­iza­tion where the system never imposes any­thing but what is rel­a­tive: the demand of “lib­erty” is never any­thing but going fur­ther than the system, but in the same direc­tion.</p>
<p>Nei­ther the beasts nor the sav­ages know “nature” in our way: they only know <em>ter­ri­to­ries</em>, lim­ited, marked, which are spaces of insur­mount­able rec­i­proc­ity.</p></li>
<li id="fn23"><p><a href="#fnref23" class="footnote-back">23.</a> Thus, Henri Laborit refuses the inter­pre­ta­tion of ter­ri­tory in terms of instinct or pri­vate prop­erty: “One has never brought forth as evi­dence, either in the hypo­thal­a­mus or else­where, either a cel­lu­lar group or neural path­ways that are dif­fer­en­ti­ated in rela­tion to the notion of ter­ri­tory… No ter­ri­to­rial center seems to exist… It is not useful to appeal to a par­tic­u­lar instinct”—but it is useful to do so in order to better return it to a func­tion­al­ity of needs extended to include cul­tural behav­iors, which today is the vul­gate common to eco­nom­ics, psy­chol­ogy, soci­ol­ogy, etc.: “The ter­ri­tory thus becomes the space nec­es­sary to the real­iza­tion of the act of bestow­ing, the vital space… The bubble, the ter­ri­tory thus rep­re­sent the morsel of space in imme­di­ate con­tact with the organ­ism, the one in which it ‘opens’ its ther­mo­dy­namic exchanges in order to main­tain its own struc­ture… With the grow­ing inter­de­pen­dence of human indi­vid­u­als, with the promis­cu­ity that char­ac­ter­izes the great modern cities, the indi­vid­ual bubble has shrunk con­sid­er­ably…” Spa­tial, func­tional, home­o­static con­cep­tion.

<li id="fn24"><p><a href="#fnref24" class="footnote-back">24.</a> The allu­sion to <em>Peter Schlemihl, the Man Who Lost His Shadow</em>, is not acci­den­tal. Since the shadow, like the image in the mirror (in The Stu­dent from Prague), is a remain­der par excel­lence, some­thing that can “fall” from the body, just like hair, excre­ment, or nail clip­pings to which it “is” com­pared in all archaic magic. But they are also, one knows, “metaphors” of the soul, of breath, of Being, of essence, of what pro­foundly gives mean­ing to the sub­ject. With­out an image or with­out a shadow, the body becomes a trans­par­ent noth­ing, <em>it is itself noth­ing but a remain­der</em>. It is the diaphanous sub­stance that remains once the shadow is gone. There is no more real­ity: it is the shadow that has car­ried all real­ity away with it (thus in The Stu­dent from Prague, the image broken by the mirror brings with it the imme­di­ate death of the hero—clas­sic sequence of fan­tas­tic tales—see also <em>The Shadow</em> by Hans Chris­tian Ander­sen). Thus the body can be noth­ing but the waste prod­uct of its own residue, the fall­out of its own fall­out. Only the order said to be real per­mits priv­i­leg­ing the body as ref­er­ence. But noth­ing in the sym­bolic order per­mits bet­ting on the pri­macy of one or the other (of the body or the shadow). And it is this rever­sion of the shadow onto the body, this fall­out of the essen­tial, by the terms of the essen­tial, under the rubric of the insignif­i­cant, this inces­sant defeat of mean­ing before what remains of it, be they nail clip­pings or the “objet petit a,” that cre­ates the charm, the beauty, and the dis­qui­et­ing strange­ness of these sto­ries.</p></li>
<li id="fn25"><p><a href="#fnref25" class="footnote-back">25.</a> More­over, con­tem­po­rary strikes nat­u­rally take on the same qual­i­ties as work: the same sus­pen­sion, the same weight, the same absence of objec­tives, the same allergy to deci­sions, the same turn­ing round of power, the same mourn­ing of energy, the same unde­fined cir­cu­lar­ity in todays strike as in yes­ter­day’s work, the same sit­u­a­tion in the coun­terin­sti­tu­tion as in the insti­tu­tion: the con­ta­gion grows, the circle is closed—after that it will be nec­es­sary to emerge else­where. Or, rather, the oppo­site: take this impasse itself as the basic sit­u­a­tion, turn the inde­ci­sion and the absence of an objec­tive into an offen­sive sit­u­a­tion, a strat­egy. In search­ing at any price to wrench one­self from this mortal sit­u­a­tion, from this mental anorexia of the uni­ver­sity, the stu­dents do noth­ing but breathe energy again into an insti­tu­tion long since in a coma; it is forced sur­vival, it is the medicine of des­per­a­tion that is prac­ticed today on both insti­tu­tions and indi­vid­u­als, and that every­where is the sign of the same inca­pac­ity to con­front death. “One must push what is col­laps­ing,” said Niet­zsche.</p></li>
